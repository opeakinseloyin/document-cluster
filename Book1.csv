Business,"Shanghai Covid: Oil prices slide after city starts lockdown
A man gets tested for Covid-19 at a makeshift testing site behind barriers of an area under lockdown in Shanghai
Global oil prices have fallen as China starts to implement a city-wide lockdown in Shanghai, an important financial and manufacturing hub.
Brent crude lost more than $3 a barrel on concerns that the move would mean that demand for oil will fall.
The Shanghai Composite stock index fell in early trade before regaining most of the losses later in the morning.
The lockdown, which began on Monday, is China's largest since the coronavirus outbreak began more than two years ago.
Until now, Chinese authorities had resisted locking down the city of almost 25 million people to avoid destabilising the world's second largest economy.
The city will be locked down in two stages over nine days while authorities carry out Covid-19 testing.
The key financial centre has battled a new wave of infections for nearly a month, although case numbers are not high by some international standards.
It comes after lockdowns in China affected tens of millions of people across the country earlier this month, including the entire Jilin province and the technology hub of Shenzhen.
The futures contract for Brent crude - an international benchmark for oil prices - was down by 2.8% at $117.30 in late morning trade.
Traders were concerned about the effectiveness of China's zero-tolerance policy towards Covid, said Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management.
Mr Innes also said in a note to investors that there were expectations of further supply chain disruptions as well as a fall in demand.
""We might be only dealing with the tip of the iceberg,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the Shanghai Composite stock index opened lower on Monday before rebounding to trade down by just 0.13% at lunchtime.
China announces Shanghai lockdown
How is China's zero-Covid strategy changing?
Shanghai's public transport has been suspended and firms and factories in the city have been ordered to halt operations or work remotely.
The lockdown will take place in two stages, starting on Monday with the eastern side of Shanghai, which includes the city's financial centre.
From Friday, the western side of Shanghai is scheduled to go into lockdown.
This staggered approach means that half of the city will be able to remain open.
Some businesses had already stopped operating in Shanghai, which has been battling a new wave of Covid infections for nearly a month.
Last week, the Shanghai Disney Resort said it would close until further notice, citing the ""current pandemic situation"".
""We will continue to monitor the pandemic situation and consult local authorities, and will notify guests as soon as we have a confirmed date to resume operations,"" it said.

China's financial capital, home to almost 25m people - Shanghai is now a divided city.
Everyone east of its main river is now locked down. Another round of mass testing has started.
By the weeks end the western half of the city will be shut.
Public transport is being closed and the city sealed off. Anyone leaving needs to show a negative test.
It is all part of a huge effort to try to stop the spread of a resurgent virus that China's leaders thought they had banished.
Anyone testing positive here is sent to hospital or forced quarantine.
As the numbers continue to rise china's insistence on a zero-Covid strategy is being tested - but also subtly adapted."
Business,"P&O Ferries sackings: Ferry operators face minimum wage law change
Ministers plan to force all ferry companies operating from UK ports to pay at least the National Minimum Wage, in a bid to persuade P&O Ferries to reinstate 800 workers it has sacked.
Legislation will be introduced in the Commons later this week.
A source says Transport Secretary Grant Shapps hopes the company will ""see reason and step back"".
But unions have said workers should be reinstated on their existing terms not the National Minimum Wage.
P&O Ferries prompted outrage on 17 March when it announced that it would be replacing staff immediately with agency workers paid less than the minimum wage.
Chief executive Peter Hebblethwaite has faced calls to resign, backed by the prime minister, after he admitted to MPs last week that he had known sacking the workers without notice was against the law.
On Saturday, protests took place at several ports, with unions holding demonstrations at Dover, Hull and Liverpool.

P&O Ferries security ‘treated staff like criminals’
What are my rights if I am made redundant?
The government now plans to close a legal loophole which allows ferry operators using UK ports but registered overseas to pay less than the minimum wage.
The UK minimum hourly rate is £8.91, while the average rate paid to the agency staff brought in by P&O Ferries would be £5.50.
A source said the transport secretary would write to Mr Hebblethwaite telling him that if ""he doesn't perform a U-turn, we will force him to do it anyway"".
""We will make it impossible for ferry companies to operate from UK ports without paying the National Minimum Wage,"" they added.
Efforts to change the law will begin on Wednesday or Thursday of this week.
Unions had raised fears over a lack of training of new crew, and on Friday the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) detained P&O Ferries' vessel European Causeway in Northern Ireland.
The ship was held in Larne over ""failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training"", the MCA said. P&O Ferries said it would make changes to return the ship to service.
The Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers Union said it would not accept the National Minimum Wage for its members, and that P&O Ferries should honour their existing contracts of employment.
The union's national secretary, Darren Proctor, said ferry operators paying below minimum wage had ""contributed to the decimation of UK seafarers"" and higher wages would create more opportunities for UK workers.
However, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme customers may have to pay higher prices as a result.
""If you want decent terms and conditions and decent service and safe vessels then you might have to pay a little bit more,"" he said.
P&O Ferries has said it had to replace crews because it was losing £100m a year and would not be a viable business without making the changes.
Bosses from two of the company's competitors, DFDS and Stena Lines, are set to meet Department for Transport officials later to discuss the planned changes to the law as well as measures to tackle possible Easter travel problems if P&O services remain disrupted.
On Monday, P&O Ferries said its Dover-Calais route would remain suspended until 31 March. Sailings were originally expected to resume on 29 March.
A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""Ministers are working to understand how we can ensure the continuation of services in collaboration with other operators, including DFDS and Stena."""
Business,"Big regional divide on some energy bill charges
Sharp rises in standing charges on standard electricity bills will see customers face very different cost increases depending on where they live.
Customers in South Scotland, Merseyside, North Wales and the South West of England will see the daily payments double from April.
Those in London and the East of England will see increases of less than 60%.
All consumer bills include a standing charge; a fixed daily payment covering the costs of supply and other levies.
The regulator Ofgem caps them for consumers on standard default tariffs in England, Wales and Scotland, although the cap varies by region.
Standing charges are not the biggest part of an energy bill, but they are set to rise by more than £71 a year on average in April.
'Not surprised'
Jeehan Saleh and Hesham Hussain told the BBC the wide regional differences were unfair at time when energy bills are soaring.
They say they ""weren't shocked"" when they learned that standing charges where they live in Garston in South Liverpool would rise by double that of other areas.
""Surprise, surprise, Liverpool again isn't it,"" said Hesham.
""It's always us being hit the hardest,"" added Jeehan. ""There's people in poorer areas where we work who are choosing between food bills and energy bills. Thankfully we're not in that position but it's not too far from home. You're already feeling it in so many areas, this is just another hit.""
The standing charge has always varied depending on where you live, due to different costs to supply homes with power in rural or more remote areas.
What help with bills is there in my council tax band?
Energy bills could reach £3,000 as oil price soars
However, BBC research has shown that the increase this spring varies disproportionately in different parts of Britain, when comparing standard variable tariffs for electricity paid for by direct debit.
Analysts told the BBC that local distributors and suppliers are moving charges which were once part of a consumer's unit price for energy (which now has a tight upper limit on it) over to their standing charge. They are also increasing standing charges to the maximum level for each region, which means a big jump for some places.
The average increase - of just under 20p per day - will add more than £71 a year to a standard electricity tariff. But in North Wales and Merseyside, the South West, the Midlands, South Scotland and South Wales the rise will add over £80 a year. In London less than £30 will be added.
The cap on standard charges will increase more in some areas than others
Price per day for Single Rate Electricity Meter from April 2022 by British region in order of percentage charge.
London: up 8p a day to 31p - a 38% increase
Eastern: up 13p a day to 36p - a 58% increase
South East: up 17p a day to 40p - a 73% increase
North West: up 17p a day to 40p - 73% increase
Southern: up 18p a day to 41p - an 80% increase
Yorkshire: up 21p a day to 46p - an 81% increase
North Scotland: up 22p a day to 48p - a 83% increase
Northern: up 21p a day to 46p - an 85% increase
East Midlands: up 20p a day to 43p - an 88% increase
Midlands: up 22p a day to 46p - a 92% increase
South Wales: up 23p a day to 46p -a 94% increase
Southern Scotland: up 24p a day to 47p - a 100% increase
South Western: up 25p a day to 49p - a 101% increase
North Wales & Merseyside: up 23p a day to 45p - 102% increase
The changes are slightly different for customers using prepayment meters.
It comes as households in England, Scotland and Wales prepare for an even bigger hit when the energy price cap - which limits what consumer pay per unit of gas and electricity - also goes up in April.
In Liverpool, David and Joan Boyle told us their energy bill was rising by £700. They are happy they will be able to manage but say they worry about other people.
Elsewhere there was more concern.
""Standing charges should be the same everywhere shouldn't they,"" said Kev Oloughlin. He was enjoying a day out in the sunshine with his son Leo. He told us they'd ""normally shop around every year when bills come in, but at the moment it's pointless"".
He added: ""We're managing alright with things but we're conscious of having the heating and things like that on. Everyone's got to tighten their belt at the minute haven't they.""
The standing charge not only covers costs such network maintenance, administration fees and certain government schemes. It is also the part of your bill that will contribute to the cost of the 28 energy suppliers that have gone bust since last autumn amid a cost crunch sparked by sharply rising wholesale energy prices.
Ofgem told the BBC that the levy added to bills to pay for costs associated with energy suppliers going bust had been spread equally across the country.
It says standing charges in some regions are increasing more than others because of a reallocation of network costs, the level of which differs between distribution networks.
Unavoidable cost
The BBC contacted major suppliers British Gas, Scottish Power, EDF, EOn, Ovo/SSE, Shell, Octopus and Bulb, and almost all confirmed they now have a majority of customers on a standard default tariff, which is controlled by the Ofgem cap.
Three of the biggest suppliers, British Gas, Scottish and Ovo/SSE would not give details on their charges, calling them ""commercially sensitive"".
But EOn, EDF, Shell, Octopus and Bulb confirmed they were increasing standing charges on these tariffs in line with the standard charge cap, with example prices (including VAT) from Bulb, EDF and Shell varying from 32p a day in London and 38p in the East, to around 50p in Northern Scotland and the South West.
And it is not an expense that can be avoided by shopping around. While tariffs actively chosen by customers, such as fixed rate tariffs, are not subject to the default tariff cap on standard charges, there are only a handful of such deals on the market.
Moneysupermarket told the BBC that as of 14 March, there were just five fixed tariffs available to consumers. This compares to about 96 fixed deals available at the same time in 2021.
Standing charges are certainly not the biggest part of your energy bill, and they are dwarfed by the massive increases in the unit price for the energy you use.
But in normal circumstances an extra £80 a year on your energy bill just from standing charges would not go unnoticed, especially as in some areas they are increasing by a lot more than others. So is something fishy going on?
Ofgem assures me that the extra costs for failed energy companies are being spread equally across the country.
But the Energy Networks Association say that no major network developments have happened in any areas in the last six months that would explain the regional divisions.
Local distributors and suppliers are moving charges which were once part of your unit price, which now has a tight price cap on it, and shifting them across to your standing charge. Most suppliers are upping their standing charges to the maximum level for each region, which means a big jump for some places, adding insult to the injury of a whopping energy bill.

Business,"P&O Ferries ship detained over crew training concerns
A P&O Ferries ship is being held in Northern Ireland because it is ""unfit to sail"", nine days after the company sacked 800 workers without notice.
The European Causeway had been held in Larne over ""failures on crew familiarisation, vessel documentation and crew training"", the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said.
P&O Ferries said it would make changes to return the ship to service.
Protests at UK ports are calling on customers to boycott the company.
They gathered in Dover, Hull and Liverpool, chanting slogans such as ""don't go P&O"" and ""seize the ship"".
Protestors from the RMT Union are attempting to block access to the Pride of Rotterdam in Hull docks.
Meanwhile, the Trades Union Congress tweeted a video it said showed P&O dockers in Rotterdam refusing to load freight onto a ferry set for Hull in solidarity with sacked workers.

Calls grow for P&O boss to quit
Unions have raised fears over a lack of training of new crew, after the firm replaced their members with workers whose average hourly rate of pay would be £5.50, less than the UK minimum wage.
As the company's ships operate internationally and are registered overseas, the UK minimum hourly rate of £8.91 does not apply.
At the Dover protest, RMT union national secretary Darren Procter said: ""Bringing a crew on board a vessel they're not familiar with to sail across the busiest shipping lane in the world, carrying passengers, is going to be a dangerous act.""
He said the MCA should detain every other P&O Ferries vessel around the UK on the basis they are not fit to sail.
The European Causeway sails between Larne and Cairnryan in Scotland. P&O Ferries told customers on Twitter that its services on this route were suspended, adding: ""It is no longer possible for us to arrange travel via an alternative operator on this route.
""For essential travel, customers are advised to seek alternatives themselves.""
There were no passengers or freight aboard the European Causeway when it was impounded in Larne, the MCA confirmed.
It said the vessel would remain under detention until all issues were resolved by P&O Ferries.
'Not sustainable'
Seamus Leheny, of freight industry body Logistics UK, said rival ferry operator Stena had increased capacity through Belfast by 50% but the situation was still causing difficulties for businesses.
""It's not sustainable to have so much freight coming through Belfast... we want that Larne service back up and running as soon as possible,"" he added.
On Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson backed Transport Secretary Grant Shapps's calls for the boss of P&O Ferries to resign.
Peter Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs that he broke the law by not consulting workers ahead of the job cuts - but said he would do the same again if he had to.
Media caption,
‘P&O Ferries weren’t just jobs they were our homes’
Mr Shapps wrote on social media that the European Causeway's detention followed an instruction from him to the MCA to inspect ""all P&O vessels"" before they entered back into service.
""I will not compromise the safety of these vessels, and P&O will not be able to rush inexperienced crew through training,"" he added.
Labour's Louise Haigh called for the sacked workers to be reinstated and for Mr Hebblethwaite to be ""barred"" as a director.
""The shameful misconduct of P&O Ferries has ruined livelihoods, and is harming the UK's key shipping routes,"" the shadow transport secretary wrote on Twitter.
P&O Ferries said in a statement that an MCA inspection had deemed the European Causeway ""not sufficiently ready for entry into operation"".
""We shall review the findings, make any changes required and continue to work closely with the MCA to return the ship to service.""
Meanwhile P&O Ferries services between Dover and Calais remain cancelled. The firm said it would organise an alternative carrier for passengers.
Saturday evening's service from Rotterdam to Hull is also suspended, the firm said - but the evening service from Hull to Rotterdam is expected to sail on time."
Business,"Uber granted two-and-a-half year licence to operate in London
Uber said it was ""delighted"" to be able to continue operating in London
Uber has been granted a two-and-a-half year licence to operate private hire vehicles in London.
The ride-hailing firm was previously denied a licence by Transport for London in November 2019.
But in September 2020, a judge upheld Uber's appeal against the decision and granted it an 18-month licence.
Uber said it was ""delighted"" to be able to continue operating in the city and that it was ""pleased"" to have met Transport for London's standards.
At the court hearing in 2020, deputy chief magistrate Tan Ikram said he had taken Uber's ""track record of regulation breaches"" into account but recognised the company had made efforts to address failings and had improved standards.
Uber said Transport for London ""rightly holds our industry to the highest regulatory and safety standards""
A spokeswoman for Transport for London (TfL) said: ""Uber has been granted a London private hire vehicle operator's licence for a period of two-and-a-half years.""
On Twitter, Uber said: ""We're delighted to announce TfL has granted Uber a new 30 month licence in London.
""TfL rightly holds our industry to the highest regulatory and safety standards and we are pleased to have met their high bar.
""As we continue to serve London, we remain focused on raising industry standards in all areas.
""These include offering drivers the benefits and protections they deserve, ensuring all Londoners can get around safely and becoming a fully electric platform by 2025.""
In February 2021, the UK's Supreme Court ruled Uber drivers must be treated as workers rather than self-employed.
The decision meant drivers could be entitled to minimum wage and holiday pay.

Business,"Calls for P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite to resign grow
Transport Secretary Grant Shapps: ""It's breathtakingly arrogant what they have done""
The prime minister has backed calls for the boss of P&O Ferries to resign over the no-notice sackings of 800 staff.
Boris Johnson supported Transport Secretary Grant Shapps in urging Peter Hebblethwaite to step down after his ""brazen"" law breaking, No 10 said.
He admitted to MPs that he broke the law by not consulting workers but said he would do the same again if he had to.
A government spokesperson said it has asked for a review of P&O's actions.
P&O Ferries replaced staff with agency workers paid less than the minimum wage.
Mr Hebblethwaite prompted further anger when he told the transport committee P&O ""did choose not to consult"" on the move and ""did not believe there was any other way to do this"".
P&O's owner DP World had warned Mr Shapps that Irish Ferries was a new ""low-cost competitor"" that would pose a challenge to the business, minutes from a meeting in November revealed.
Mr Shapps had replied to DP World boss DP Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem: ""I'm aware of the issues relating to P&O. I recognise you will need to make commercial decisions, but please do keep us informed.""
But the transport secretary told BBC Breakfast the first he knew of the P&O sackings was when he was ""stood at the despatch box"" in the Commons last Thursday delivering a statement on another issue.
He added that even if he had known in advance, ""it wouldn't have made any difference"", because P&O Ferries had already hired agency staff, security, and recorded the video ""behind everybody's backs"".
The BBC has seen a letter Mr Hebblethwaite sent to P&O colleagues on Friday telling them ""this type of dismissal could not and would not happen again"".
He called it a ""unique situation"" and said no criminal offence had been committed.
He wrote that there had been ""a failure to comply with the obligation to consult"".
P&O Ferries had made redundancies due to pandemic pressures before the mass sackings, but had previously consulted unions.

P&O boss admits not consulting on job cuts broke law
P&O Ferries offers £100,000 to some sacked staff
Friday's talks between union officials and P&O ended after 20 minutes without any agreement, the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said.
General secretary Mick Lynch said: ""P&O were not prepared to listen to any scenario or develop any idea that would provide a means to create a solution to the current disastrous situation.""
It has called for the immediate disqualification of Mr Hebblethwaite as a director. It also wants the government to reinstate sacked workers in their jobs.
The Institute of Directors has said Mr Hebblethwaite could face court proceedings under the Company Directors Disqualification Act (1986).
Dr Roger Barker, director of policy and governance, said this was due to Mr Hebblethwaite's suggestion that P&O knowingly broke the law by not consulting staff.
""[Mr Hebblethwaite] leaves himself and the rest of the board vulnerable to court proceedings for unfit conduct and the potential for disqualification as a director, not just of P&O but any UK company.""
Media caption,
‘P&O Ferries weren’t just jobs they were our homes’
Labour's shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, also called on the government to disqualify Mr Hebblethwaite as a company director.
She told BBC News: ""The government can do more than just wait for the chief executive to go. The government should be investigating action against him to disqualify him as a company director now and in the future as well.""
Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast the government would bring in measures next week to force P&O Ferries into a U-turn to re-employ staff on at least minimum wage.
These changes would also affect the operator Irish Ferries, who he said have used ""the same model"".
Asked about the action government could take against P&O, Mr Shapps admitted it ""can't directly"" revoke P&O's licence but said ""we do have some mechanisms"".
""There are a whole load of other things happening including letters going out to the ports from which they sail, then, as I mentioned, different types of legislation will be forthcoming, so we are going to make sure P&O have to U-turn on this.""
However, Beth Hale, partner at employment law firm CM Murray, questioned the government's capacity to force through a change.
""It's not clear what mechanisms the government is proposing to rely on to force a U-turn in this matter. The dismissals of the employees have already taken effect - and some may already have signed up to settlement agreements and accepted termination payments.
""There is no mechanism in the law as it currently stands which would allow the government or unions to force an employer to re-engage employees in those circumstances,"" she said, adding that pressure could be applied in different ways such as the Insolvency Service disqualifying individual P&O Ferries directors.
A government spokesperson said that it has asked the Insolvency Service to review P&O Ferries' actions.
""This will include any scope to take legal action against the company's directors. We will not hesitate to take further action if we find evidence of wrongdoing,"" they added.
P&O Ferries has said its 800 redundant staff will be offered £36.5m in total - with around 40 getting more than £100,000 each.
The company said some employees are set to get 91 weeks' pay and the chance of new employment, and no employee would receive less than £15,000.
Mr Shapps also told Radio 4's Today programme: ""What they've done is try to pay off, or attempt to pay off, their staff with higher redundancy payments...and therefore buy their silence and we cannot have a situation where laws are being creatively used and abused in this case.""
He said: ""The idea that you come to parliament and you admit that you deliberately set out to break the laws in order to sack your staff and bring in below minimum wage people and that you'll buy off the staff to do that is quite simply unacceptable.
""They've exploited loopholes, they've been completely disgraceful and I'm clear that is no way to behave and not the right individual to have at the top of a British business."""
Business,"Russia considers accepting Bitcoin for oil and gas
Russia is considering accepting Bitcoin as payment for its oil and gas exports, according to a high-ranking lawmaker.
Pavel Zavalny says ""friendly"" countries could be allowed to pay in the crypto-currency or in their local currencies.
Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he wanted ""unfriendly"" countries to buy its gas with roubles.
The move is understood to be aimed at boosting the Russian currency, which has lost over 20% in value this year.
Sanctions imposed by the UK, US and the European Union, following the invasion of Ukraine, have put a strain on Russia's rouble and raised its cost of living.
However, Russia is still the world's biggest exporter of natural gas and the second largest supplier of oil.
Mr Zavalny, who heads Russia's State Duma committee on energy, said on Thursday that the country has been exploring alternative ways to receive payment for energy exports.
He said China and Turkey were among ""friendly"" countries which were ""not involved in the sanctions pressure"".
""We have been proposing to China for a long time to switch to settlements in national currencies for roubles and yuan,"" said Mr Zavalny. ""With Turkey, it will be lira and roubles.""
Mr Zavalny added: ""You can also trade bitcoins.""
'More risk'
Analysts said Russia may benefit from accepting the popular cryptocurrency, despite the risks.
""Russia is very quickly feeling the impact of unprecedented sanctions,"" said David Broadstock, a senior research fellow at the Energy Studies Institute in Singapore. ""There is a need to shore up the economy and in many ways, Bitcoin is seen as a high growth asset.""
However, he noted that the value of Bitcoin has swung by as much as 30% this year. In comparison, the dollar has traded within 5% against the euro.
""Clearly accepting Bitcoin, compared with other traditional currencies, introduces considerably more risk in the trade of natural gas,"" Mr Broadstock said.
""Moreover, one of the major 'friendly' trade partners for Russia is China, and cryptocurrency is banned for use in China,"" he added. ""This clearly limits potential for payment using Bitcoin.""
Are cryptocurrencies a lifeline for Afghans?
Millions in Bitcoin donations pour into Ukraine
There are concerns that Russian oligarchs could be using virtual currencies to avoid sanctions.
This has spurred Ukraine's government as well as US and European politicians to ask crypto-currency platforms to ban all Russian users.
But many firms have ruled this out.
""Some ordinary Russians are using crypto as a lifeline now that their currency has collapsed,"" said Brian Armstrong, chief executive of cryptocurrency firm Coinbase.
He said: ""Many of them likely oppose what their country is doing, and a ban would hurt them, too.""
On Wednesday, Mr Putin's comments on making ""unfriendly"" countries pay in roubles drove the currency to a three-week high.
However, many existing gas contracts are agreed upon in euros and it is unclear if Russia can change them. The EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas."
Business,"Russia's cost of living soars by more than 14%
The cost of living in Russia is surging following the country's invasion of Ukraine, according to new data.
Official figures show price of some household staples - such as sugar - have jumped by as much as 14% over the past week.
Inflation is set to keep rising in Russia where the rouble has fallen sharply since the Ukraine war began.
The value of the currency has dropped about 22% this year, and this has pushed up the cost of importing goods.
The inflation data came as the Russian stock market resumed trading on Thursday after a month-long hiatus, with the majority of shares rising in a volatile trading session.
The benchmark Moex index closed 4.4% higher after surging over 10% in Moscow.
Analysts said a government plan to buy billions of dollars worth of Russian shares was supporting the market, which dived last month after Russia invaded its neighbour.
Bans on trade with foreigners and on short-selling remain in place.
'The biggest culprit'
On Wednesday, Russia's economic ministry said annual inflation had jumped 14.5% in the week ending 18 March - the highest rate since late 2015.
The Federal State Statistics Service said the cost of sugar rose by as much as 37.1% in certain regions of the country and increased by an average 14%.
Sugar, which is commonly used to preserve food or make liquor, was the biggest gainer in the week, the government agency found.
Prices of sugar have jumped 14% in Russia
The price of onions was the second biggest riser over the week, up 13.7% nationwide and 40.4% in some areas. Meanwhile, nappies were 4.4% more expensive. Prices for black tea rose 4% and toilet paper increased by 3%.
Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management, said prices were higher because of the weaker rouble.
""The biggest culprit is imported inflation,"" Mr Innes told the BBC. ""Anything Russia imports is exponentially (pricier) due to the weaker rouble.""
The UK, the US and the European Union have cut off a number Russian banks from financial markets in the West.
They have also prohibited dealings with Russia's central bank, state-owned investment funds and the finance ministry.
The Bank of Russia more than doubled its interest rate to 20% in March, in an attempt to stop its currency from sliding further.
A large number of Western businesses have pulled out of Russia because of the war in Ukraine. Others, such as the Swiss food giant Nestle, have withdrawn major brands such as KitKat and Nesquik.
Videos on social media show shoppers scrambling to buy sugar and buckwheat at supermarkets in Moscow.
Deputy prime minister Viktoria Abramchenko has told Russians the country is ""fully self-sufficient when it comes to sugar and buckwheat"".
""There is no need to panic buy these goods. There is enough for everybody,"" she said.
'Already noticeable'
But some Russians told the BBC that they were feeling the squeeze.
Ksenia Mironiuk said the price of many basic goods had ""gone up dramatically"" in St Petersburg.
""It's already quite noticeable when you go shopping,"" she said. ""Lots of people are buying them in bulk fearing they will disappear altogether.""
Merkutsio Anzhello, who lives in the southern city of Krasnodar, said staples now cost 10 to 20% more.
But he said he is not too concerned: ""In general, neither I nor my relatives are not concerned about it. Prices in Russia grow sometimes and we are accustomed to this.""
Russia has hit back at international sanctions, and threatened to seize the assets of businesses that have stopped operating in the country.
It sanctioned US President Joe Biden and 12 other US officials last week.
On Wednesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the country would start selling natural gas to ""unfriendly"" countries in roubles. It is understood the move is aimed at supporting the currency.
The EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas. However, many existing contracts are agreed upon in euros and it is unclear if Russia can change them.
Mr Putin's announcement drove the rouble to a three-week high. It later closed at 97.7 against the dollar."
Business,"Dairy giant Arla warns of supply issues unless farmers paid more
The UK's largest dairy has warned milk supplies could be under threat unless its farmers are paid more.
The managing director of Arla Foods said costs are increasing at rates never seen before and that farmers can no longer cover their expenses.
""Because of the recent crisis, feed, fuel and fertiliser have rocketed and therefore cashflow on the farm is negative,"" said Ash Amirahmadi.
He added farmers are producing less milk as a result of the higher costs.
""UK dairy farmers have been producing more for about the last seven to eight years but it's now going the other way,"" Mr Amirahmadi told the BBC.
""In February, they produced 2% less and in March it's 4%.""
With cost increases of some 36%, he warned farmers are facing some hard decisions and that they need confidence to carry on producing.
And that means securing a higher price from Arla's customers - the supermarkets.
""The most important thing now is that we put our arm around the farmers…and pay our farmers more to cover their costs to make sure the milk is flowing, "" said Mr Amirahmadi.
Arla Foods is the fifth biggest dairy company in the world and the largest supplier of fresh milk and cream in the UK. The co-operative has 2,100 dairy farmers in the UK and 8,950 across Europe.

David Christensen, an Arla dairy farmer based in Oxfordshire, said he had ""never experienced conditions like this in 30 years"" of working in the industry.
His fertiliser bill has jumped from £350 to £900 a tonne and his fuel has more than doubled - cost increases he won't be able to absorb after the summer.
""There's no doubt, if the economics don't stack up one of the options is to scale back production...milk prices need to go up. It's no longer sustainable,"" he said.
The boss of Arla said the price of milk in the shops is 7% lower now than it was 10 years ago.
But the price consumers pay is different to the prices which farmers receive to produce it.
For farmers the break even price is key. This includes any extra income and government subsidies.
Over the years, the industry has kept costs down by becoming more efficient and many supermarkets have direct contracts with farmers based on their own cost of production models to try to give them a fairer deal.
But industry sources have said even these so-called aligned contracts are failing to keep up with sky rocketing costs.
Mr Amirahmadi's comments come as his business unveiled a five-year plan to grow and future proof the business at the same time it faces pressure from surges in inflation.
Arla believes increasing global demand for dairy is an opportunity for farmers in the UK. The prices paid to farmers abroad are now 15% higher than the prices paid to farmers here.
It's already trialling the export of fresh British milk for processing at its European sites which is then sold on international markets.
The dairy giant is the first producer to consider doing this at scale.
""The good news here for farmers and actually the British dairy industry is that the opportunities of export give farmers more options and therefore it means that the whole of the UK dairy industry should get a lift as a result of those markets,"" Mr Amirahmadi said.
As for the UK, he believes the dynamics need to change. He said for too many years the liquid milk market has been failing to deliver for farmers.
""Over the next five years we will have to make some tough decisions about where our milk goes to ensure farmers can cover their costs and continue to invest in reducing their on-farm emissions,"" he added.
""The profitability of some of our milk contracts will need to increase significantly when up for renewal in order to compete with more attractive business opportunities that are opening up."""
Business,"P&O Ferries: Not consulting on job cuts broke law, boss admits
P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite faces MPs
P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite has admitted to MPs that a decision to sack 800 workers last week without notice broke the law.
He said there was ""absolutely no doubt"" that under UK employment law the firm was required to consult unions before making the mass cuts.
However, he said no union would have accepted the plan and it was easier to compensate workers ""in full"" instead.
The P&O boss also said he would make the same decision again if he had to.
Huw Merriman, the Conservative chair of the Transport Committee urged him to resign.
""It's untenable to come to parliament and say you decided to break the law, you have no regrets,"" Mr Merriman told BBC Radio 4's World at One.
""We can't have companies run by people like that. So he needs to hand his card in.""
The sackings of P&O staff sparked outrage after it emerged they will be replaced by foreign agency workers paid less than the minimum wage.
Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal?
P&O Ferries offers £100,000 to some sacked staff
Addressing a committee of MPs on Thursday, Mr Hebblethwaite apologised for the distress caused by the cuts, but said they were necessary to save the business which has been loss-making.
He said workers would receive ""extremely generous"" compensation, although as part of these settlements they would forgo their right to pursue further legal action against P&O.
Asked whether P&O broke the law by not consulting the unions, Mr Hebblethwaite said: ""It was our assessment that the change [to staffing] was of such a magnitude that no union could possibly accept our proposal.
""So as I say, I completely throw our hands up, my hands up, that we did choose not to consult.""
He added: ""We did not believe there was any other way to do this and we are compensating people in full.""
Asked if he would change anything about the decision made last Thursday, he responded: ""That's a really, really difficult question.
""The business would close, the business was not viable. This is the only way for us to save this business and we have moved to a model that is internationally recognised and widely used across the globe and by our competitors.
""I would make this decision again I'm afraid.""
Peter Hebblethwaite apologised to workers. But he remained adamant there had been no other option and gave no indication that he would change course.
MPs were aghast at his open admission that the business had chosen not to comply with the requirement to consult unions over planned redundancies.
A representative of DP World, which owns P&O, said Mr Hebblethwaite would not be sacked.
But after this morning's appearance, the calls for him to resign are growing.
No P&O worker will get less than £15,000 in compensation, he said, and a small number will receive more than £100,000.
Mr Hebblethwaite, who earns £325,000 a year as a base salary, said he could not say whether he would get a performance-related bonus after the sackings.
In 2020, the directors of P&O were paid £1.9m in total, and the highest paid director got £452,000.
Mr Hebblethwaite told MPs that the average hourly rate of pay for new P&O crewmembers would be £5.50 per hour, which is below the UK minimum wage. However, it is in line with international maritime standards.
From 1 April, the UK minimum wage for people aged 23 and over will be £9.50.
Mr Hebblethwaite said that the firm's new operating model was consistent with ""models throughout the globe and our competitors"".
Former P&O worker John said he was 'sickened and shocked' by the hearing
By sacking its crews and taking on agency staff instead, he said the business would cut its wage bill in half.
Following the hearing MP Darren Jones, who chairs the business committee, said he was ""amazed"" by Mr Hebblethwaite's evidence.
The Labour MP added: ""He should be fined, struck off and prosecuted.""
John, a former P&O seafarer, who started working in the ferry business when he was 16, also said the P&O boss should go.
""I am sickened and shocked by this man's arrogant explanation,"" he said. ""I don't even know if I've got the right words for how I'm feeling inside.""
Media caption,
The government will stop a similar firing of P&O Ferries staff after the firm “exploited a loophole”, says Grant Shapps.
Meanwhile, transport secretary Grant Shapps said he would take action to prevent similar mass sackings without notice.
He said the government would ""have a package of measures"" to remove a ""loophole in the law"" it believed had been ""exploited"" by P&O.
MPs on the committee also raised questions about the way P&O notified foreign governments that it was going to make the redundancies, which is a legal requirement.
The company informed authorities in Barbados, Bermuda and Cyprus on 17 March - but MPs said it should have done this sooner.
On Wednesday, Boris Johnson told the Commons that ""it looks like"" P&O breached a similar rule in the UK, but some employment lawyers have cast doubt on that claim.
The company denies it breached any rules in this regard."
Business,"Uber to list New York City yellow taxis in app
After ravaging New York City's yellow cab industry, Uber is now taking steps to embrace it.
The company will now list New York City yellow cabs on its app, a partnership Uber described as the latest step in a global effort to work with the taxi industry to unlock new markets.
It already has similar arrangements in place in countries such as Spain, Germany, Austria and Turkey.
Uber has been facing a driver shortage as it emerges from the pandemic.
The deal will add about 14,000 taxi drivers licensed in New York City - one of its most important markets - to Uber's platform.
Guy Peterson, director of business development for Uber, called it a ""win for drivers"".
""No longer do they have to worry about finding a fare during off-peak times to getting a street hail back to Manhattan when in the outer boroughs,"" he said.
The number of rides in yellow taxis in New York has plunged since Uber launched in the city in 2011, as people opted for the ease of online booking. The collapse helped to push nearly a thousand drivers to file for bankruptcy in recent years.
Under the partnership, the software companies that currently work with city-licensed cab drivers will integrate with Uber, which will take a cut of the fares. The companies did not say how much this would be.
The offering will roll out to the public this spring. Riders hailing a yellow taxi via the app will pay fares comparable to an Uber X ride, according to a Wall Street Journal report that Uber confirmed.
Shares in Uber rose on the news.
But Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said Uber should not make the mistake of thinking that this means its fights with drivers in New York are over. She said Uber typically pays about 15% less than what a driver could earn running the meter.
""The companies that tore up this industry need this more than the drivers do,"" said Ms Desai. ""The fare structure that is not enough for Uber drivers is also not going to be enough for yellow cab drivers.""
Bruce Schaller, a New York-based consultant who has studied the growth of Uber in the city, said the deal would benefit drivers and customers by widening market access, while helping the city control the number of empty cars adding to pollution and congestion problems as they look for customers.
""I've always felt that these industries would converge,"" he said. ""This is probably sooner than one would have expected...but clearly the pandemic has turned everything upside down and people are trying to put things back together in a way that will work.""
As Uber pursues this model in other cities, the firm may come to dominate the market even more, Mr Schaller said. But in New York City, he said hailing a taxi from the street was likely to remain an essential part of life.
""The street hail is still a big deal in New York,"" he added.
Ryan Wanttaja, the acting head of New York's Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), which regulates the industry, said it was ""always interested in tools that can expand economic opportunities for taxi drivers"".
""We are excited about any proposal to more easily connect passengers with taxis and look forward to learning more about this agreement between Uber and the taxi apps and ensuring it complies with TLC rules,"" he said.

Business,"Spotify paid 130 artists more than $5m last year
Pop star Olivia Rodrigo had the most-streamed song on Spotify last year
Spotify has revealed it paid $7bn to music industry rights holders last year, accounting for almost 25% of the industry's total revenues.
The news came on the company's Loud And Clear website, which was launched last year with the aim of ""increasing transparency"" around its payments.
The streaming giant said 52,600 artists earned more than $10,000 (£7,500) from Spotify in 2021.
Of those, 130 were paid more than $5m (£3.8m) over the last 12 months.
Spotify didn't name any of the artists involved, but its most-streamed acts last year were Bad Bunny, Taylor Swift, BTS, Drake and Justin Bieber; while the most streamed-song was Olivia Rodrigo's Drivers License.
BTS were the biggest-selling act in the world last year
However, the streaming giant's raw figures do not tell the full story.
For example, an artist whose music earns $10,000 in Spotify royalties might only receive $2,000, once the record label and publishers take their share. For a seven-piece band like BTS, that $2,000 has to be split seven ways.
Songwriters and session musicians are paid even less, with many struggling to make ends meet.
Even so, Spotify's data provides some insights into how artists are faring in the streaming era - with earnings falling into the following brackets:
$10,000 - $49,999: 36,100 artists
$50,000 - $99,999: 7,000 artists
$100,000 - $499,999: 7,330 artists
$500,000 - $999,999: 1,130 artists
$1,000,000 - $1,999,999: 590 artists
$2,000,000 - $4,999,999: 320 artists
$5m and above: 130 artists
About 28% of the artists who earned more than $10,000 last year (some 15,140) uploaded their own music via the likes of TuneCore, Ditto, DistroKid and CD Baby - which means they will have kept the bulk of their earnings.
Spotify also estimated that, once revenues from rival streaming sites and CD sales were taken into account, most of these artists will have made about $40,000 (£30,000) last year.
Of course, the musicians we're talking about represent the tip of a very sizeable iceberg.
Spotify says about eight million people have uploaded tracks to its service, with 60,000 new songs arriving every day. As a result, 99.3% of the artists on Spotify are generating less than $10,000 a year.
The company counters that more than half of the eight million artists on its database have uploaded fewer than 10 tracks, ""so they are quite early in their journey, or maybe doing it more as a hobby,"" said Spotify's global head of music product, Charlie Hellman, in an interview with Music Ally.
He added that the number of artists generating more than $10,000 has risen by 10,100 in the last 12 months - and that ""the industry is half as top-heavy and half as star-concentrated as it was in the heyday of the CD.""
Global music spending surges to $26bn
BTS were the top-selling act in the world last year
Apple and Spotify reveal 2021's most-streamed songs
This is the same argument promoted by the wider music industry, which claims more artists are making a living in the streaming era than at any other time in history.
The BPI, which represents the British music industry, says nearly 2,000 artists achieved more than 10 million UK streams in 2021, up 25% from the 2020 figure.
""The rise of streaming has empowered more artists than ever - from all backgrounds and eras - to build new fanbases around the world and to forge successful careers in music,"" said BPI chief executive Geoff Taylor in January.
Earlier this week, it was revealed that total music industry revenues rose 18.5% in 2021 to reach $25.9bn (£19.5bn), the highest level since records began in the 1990s.
On its Loud And Clear website, Spotify boasted about its contribution to that figure, claiming that its ""$7bn total is the largest sum paid by one retailer to the music industry in one year in history - including any single retailer at the height of the CD or digital download era."""
Business,"Spring Statement: Why Rishi Sunak is holding back some firepower
Energy bills are expected to jump again later this year
The takeaway message from the morning after the chancellor's statement was an acknowledgement from both the PM and Rishi Sunak that they would have to do more eventually on the cost of living.
This reflects the big choice made by the chancellor to bank the bulk of the proceeds of a rapid recovery in tax receipts. Borrowing will fall more rapidly, reflecting inflation, and previously announced tax rises.
Powder is being kept dry, while the energy cap suppresses further rises in bills. The extent of any further support can be determined in summer when it will be clear if the new cap implies average bills of an incredible £200 per month or even a truly terrifying £300 per month. That in turn depends on the war in Ukraine and supplies of energy from Russia. Not even the Office for Budget Responsibility knows where this is going to land. But there is space for a support package of several billion, if required.
Newspapers and think tanks gave a rather cool response to the Spring Statement, perhaps reflecting a change in the level of expectation of assistance from government, after the extraordinary help provided during the pandemic.
For the chancellor this was more a case of ""what we can do for now"" rather than ""whatever it takes"". Taking both the energy support package and the tax adjustments made yesterday, the government has mitigated about a third of the squeeze from surging prices.
The pandemic support worked in its primary aim. It ensured that workers did not disconnect from their employers, and prolong a self-fulfilling high unemployment downturn. But coming out of the pandemic lockdowns, many of these workers now face significant cost of living difficulties.
The chancellor's decision to roll back £6bn of the National Insurance rise is concentrated on supporting those on just below average incomes. He did not, for example, choose to spend roughly the same amount on ensuring recipients of tax credits, benefits and pensions saw their income rise in line with inflation averaging 7% now, rather than the predetermined 3%.
The net result of all that will be an increase in poverty which the Resolution Foundation think tank says has not been seen outside of a recession - a further 1.3 million in absolute poverty including 500,000 children.
Sunak accused of not doing enough for poorest
How Rishi Sunak's Spring Statement will affect you
Public sector pay is also being squeezed by rising inflation. Pay Review Bodies will decide the rise effective from next month, before the summer. The Treasury has previously indicated that pay should focus on the 2% inflation target rather than the actual rate of inflation.
Mr Sunak is also effectively squeezing public services by keeping the cash totals for spending, despite the surge in inflation. Depending on the measure of inflation, it could mean an effective £20bn cut against Spending Review plans according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, including £9.7bn for health and £1.7bn for defence.
This seems likely to be revisited too.
Overall the chancellor has kept back a tax revenue windfall, to deploy on soothing cost of living pressures for low paid workers, but not yet to spend on those on benefits or public sector workers.
It leaves options open for further support, but raises questions about the timing of policy. Under current plans, real incomes for state pensioners and tax credit recipients will be cut now, with a rise of 3%, but they will increase next year, reflecting high levels of inflation in excess of 8%, forecast for the autumn.
Likewise a tax cut of £5bn to help people's incomes has been timed for the pre-election year of 2024, yet a tax rise of £6bn is coming now at the same time the cost of living surges.
One issue for the Treasury is uncertainty about how fast energy prices and inflation will return to more normal levels. That is why they have made a big choice to hold back some firepower. The pressure to use that may come far more rapidly than expected."
Business,"Funeral firm collapses leaving fears over payments
A funeral plan provider with 45,000 customers in the UK has collapsed, throwing contracts into doubt and raising concern over refunds.
Safe Hands had already signalled its intention to stop operating, but its collapse means pre-bought funerals may not be honoured.
Administrators said the company could not provide immediate refunds, leaving many worried their money will be lost.
The sector is facing an imminent overhaul, leaving other plans in doubt.
From 29 July, any provider must be authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which, from that point onwards, will give consumers far greater protection than they have at the moment.
'What are we going to do?'
Safe Hands was one of dozens of companies operating in the currently unregulated pre-paid funeral sector.
Customers such as Lyn Burrow, 72, and her husband Fred, 80, signed up to contracts that saved their family the expense and emotional cost of organising their funerals when they die.
The couple spent a total of £6,310 on their plan, which she said had given them ""peace of mind"".
She spoke to BBC Radio 4's Money Box programme about her concerns when it emerged that Safe Hands had decided to stop operating when new regulations begin.
Now, following news that the company is in administration, those fears have heightened.
She said: ""My family was supposed not to have to worry, but what are we going to do now?""
""If we could at least recover some of the money, we could make up the difference with a reputable company. But £6,000 is a lot of money. It would have to come from our savings.""
Joint administrator Nedim Ailyan, partner at FRP, said they would carry out a detailed investigation to discover what could be returned to creditors, including policyholders - whose funds are in a trust fund, which itself has a shortfall compared to what is required for full refunds.
""Regrettably, the administration means the company is not in a position to issue refunds at this time. We appreciate how upsetting this period of uncertainty will be for Safe Hands Plans' customers and their families,"" he said.
""Unfortunately, there is a shortfall between the level of plan holder investments and the forecast level of funeral plan costs to be paid. Essentially, the value of the investments is not enough to meet the funeral plan obligations of the company.""
Any funeral plans activated in the next two weeks, because the policyholder has died, will be covered by another provider - Dignity. Mr Ailyan said a ""longer-term solution"" was being sought beyond that deadline, and customers - or their loved ones - would be contacted. A helpline has been set up on 0800 640 9928.
Funeral costs drop for first time in 18 years
Cold-calling ban among plans for pre-paid funerals
The FCA said it was reforming the sector because elderly, and very often vulnerable, customers have been subjected to unfair practices such as high pressure sales tactics and cold calls. It wants to raise standards by regulating what companies can and cannot do.
However, a FCA spokeswoman said that, in the case of Safe Hands, its powers were limited because it had yet to come under the regulator's jurisdiction.
""People who bought a pre-paid funeral plan with Safe Hands will be understandably concerned, which is why we welcome Dignity stepping in to provide funerals for the next two weeks,"" she said.
""We will continue to support the administrators and industry to see whether there is a longer-term solution for Safe Hands' customers.""
Mike Hilliar, director for funeral planning at Dignity, said: ""Dignity stands by its commitment to provide assistance where we can, and we will be working with others in the industry to come to a resolution to help customers of Safe Hands, or indeed of other plan providers that do not achieve authorisation with the regulator.""
UK funeral plan sector
1.6 million customers
200,000 funeral plans taken out every year
Approximately 65 companies
Average plan costs £4,000
Average plan lasts for 8 years
As the funeral plan market is being reformed, industry insiders are worried that this could mean more of the 65 providers will go out of business, leaving tens of thousands of customers out of pocket.
Whilst many of the larger, more reputable firms are expected to be granted authorisation by the FCA, others are unlikely to even apply for authorisation or will be turned down. If that happens they will be unable or not allowed to operate beyond 29 July.
While customers who have signed up to plans very recently can cancel during a cooling-off period, others will have to wait to see what happens to their provider and their plan."
Business,"Next warns prices to rise by more than expected
High street retail giant Next has warned it will need to increase prices even further later this year.
The retailer said prices for homeware items will jump 13% and fashion prices rise 6.5% in the second half of 2022 to average an 8% increase overall.
Clothing prices are already rising, with inflation data showing overall clothing and footwear prices rose 8.8% in the year to February 2022.
The retailer said it still expects to make a £850m profit this year.
Across the UK economy companies have been passing on higher energy, shipping and oil costs to customers, leading to surging prices for everything from tinned tomatoes and Marmite, to used cars and home insurance.
Next had already warned of incoming price rises in January, but it has now increased its estimate of price increases in the second half of the year from 6% to 8%.
It still predicts sales to grow overall - despite the price rises - but not by as much as first thought, which it said was due to the closing of its Ukrainian and Russian websites.
Next's chief executive, Lord Simon Wolfson, told the PA news agency that, given the worsening cost of living crisis, trading could be ""subdued"" for the rest of the year.
""Over the past 20 years, we've seen that what really matters is what's in people's bank accounts rather than costs,"" he said.
""In January, when we laid down our outlook, people suggested it could be pessimistic but we thought confidence could be subdued.""
The company also flagged that demand could be dented as people spend their disposable incomes elsewhere, with a return to spending on holidays abroad and other social activities.
However, for now, Next said the first three months of the year had seen UK sales ""ahead of where we expected them to be"" as people headed back to its stores after lockdown and purchased more formal fashion and fewer things for their homes.
Next also reported pre-tax profits of £823m for the year to 31 January, more than double the amount of the previous year and 10% above pre-pandemic levels."
Business,"Lloyds Bank to close 60 more branches across UK
Lloyds Banking Group has announced the closure of 60 branches across the UK.
The company said it would shut 24 Lloyds Bank branches, 19 Bank of Scotland branches and 17 Halifax branches as customers were moving towards online and mobile banking.
The Unite union said closures were ""devastating"" for communities.
Lloyds said it would try to find new roles for the 124 staff affected by the closures, which are due to take place between June and September.
The bank said the number of online banking customers had risen by 12% in the last two years, while mobile app users had increased by 27%.
Vim Maru, group retail director, said: ""Just like many other high street businesses, fewer customers are choosing to visit our branches.
""Our branch network is an important way for us to support our customers, but we need to adapt to the significant growth in customers choosing to do most of their everyday banking online.""
Link, the UK's largest cash machine network, have recommended that in three locations - Buckingham, Cottingham and Troon - banking hubs should be created where customers of all main banks can carry out day-to-day banking.
Lloyds said it would continue to operate in those locations until the hubs are established.
The group currently has 739 Lloyds branches, 553 Halifax branches and 184 Bank of Scotland sites. Last year it announced plans to close more than 90 branches.
However, Caren Evans, national officer for Unite, said Lloyds ""should not be allowed to abandon 60 more local communities where bank branches play an essential role.
""When a bank branch closes, the heart of the local community is ripped out and the results are devastating
""Unite is clear that simply leaving an ATM in place of a vibrant bank branch is wholly insufficient.""
Here is the full list of branches which will close:"
Business,"St Albans has big rise in business start-ups in lockdown
It's been two years since England's first Covid-19 lockdown and according to new analysis, St Albans has seen a large percentage growth in the number of new companies starting up. As this has also been a very challenging period for business, how have they thrived and why did they choose the cathedral city in Hertfordshire?
The St Albans district has a population of just over 147,000 and it has become known as an ideal commuter town due to its position just north of the M25, with fast - if rather crowded - rail links to central London.
Instant Offices, which specialises in finding office space, analysed Companies House data to work out which towns and cities had attracted most new businesses and found St Albans had one of the largest growth rates in the UK.
With 1,597 new companies in 2021 and 1,311 in 2020 - a 21.8% increase.
Other towns and cities with similar growth levels include Doncaster in South Yorkshire with 26.9% and Preston in Lancashire with 24.6%, according to the researchers.
Instant Offices cites a rise in remote working and online shopping as reasons for the start-ups across the UK.
'I suddenly said I'm going to start a business'
Jennifer Clarke says lockdown gave her ""the time and space to build a good base""
Jennifer Clarke had been working in payroll for her husband's business since 2014, and had also started training to be a meditation teacher when the first lockdown hit in March 2020.
""I continued my training in the first lockdown and everything also moved online,"" she says.
""I thought I could still help people this way and - as you also get wisdom and intuition through meditation - I suddenly said I'm going to start up a business.
""So I started my website and [lockdown] also gave me the time and space to build a good base and set up my social media which I'd not really been on before.""
After that, the business took off and she concentrated on it full time, setting up Meditation Courses Ltd in October 2020.
By the following January, during England's third lockdown, she was ""rushed off my feet"".
""Because of the pandemic, people are thinking how they can help themselves... thinking about their mental health more and looking for help, and companies want to look after their staff,"" she says.
""Online I'm able to reach people all over the country and around the world - I've been quite shocked at how much I've been able to help people.""
Ms Clarke, who has lived in St Albans for about 20 years says the local business community has been ""very helpful"".
Anna Venetico from St Albans Chamber of Commerce says people have ""re-evaluated the way they work""
Anna Venetico from the St Albans Chamber of Commerce said lockdowns led to people looking at ""that arduous commute"" into the capital and taking that leap to set up on their own.
""We've had accountants and marketeers going solo and digital marketing is huge,"" she says.
""We're seeing more of the creative-type marketing industries opening.
""During lockdown people had time to experience things locally and realised they didn't have to go into London... they are looking at things differently.
""We've always had a thriving business community and have all the services people need, so it's the perfect place to be.""
Rachel Kepinska-Smith agrees that the businesses that have done well are those which helped people through Covid lockdowns
""My business grew very quickly"", says Rachel Kepinska-Smith from Rachel KS Consulting, which specialises in branding.
She had left the corporate world in 2015 for better work/life balance and had already been working from home for a franchise.
She decided that on 1 March 2020 she would ""flick the switch"" and move to full-time marketing consultancy, and three weeks later the country was in lockdown.
""It was quite intense... I started the business having to home-school a nine-year-old and keep a three-year-old entertained,"" she says.
""Businesses had to refocus and diversify, but to be credible they had to focus on their niche - who are you and what difference can you make. I helped them find that.""
Ms Kepinska-Smith, who has lived in the city since 2009, says: ""You don't have to scratch the surface long before you find an ex-London person who has left to do their own thing and is well connected so people can make anything happen.
""It's scary going from PAYE to being on your own. It's tough for business owners and without the right support it's hard, so to have a community of people, who get it, around you is great.""
Rebecca Youngs from The Social Den says people have left good jobs and are ""capable of running their own business""
Social media consultant Rebecca Youngs had just set up The Social Den after retraining as a social media manager, but when Covid hit, businesses were either unable to run or could not afford to pay her so she ""lost all her client base over a week"".
She teaches businesses how to use all the features of Instagram and helps them make a content strategy, so after transferring all her business online, she did regular Instagram posts and had a very successful year.
""I started online workshops and didn't charge very much,"" she says.
""It was cheap and accessible so it got a lot of interest and my online training has grown.""
She says she feels like she ""really benefitted from the situation in 2020"" as many businesses had to really look at online strategies.
""Many barely had a website so it was a steep learning curve and I helped them,"" she says.
She adds that there are a lot of factors that make St Albans attractive.
""A lot of people have worked in London and then had families and don't want to commute, but they were in good jobs so are capable of running their own business,"" she says.
""Also it's an affluent area so there are people to buy from you; I've never struggled to find clients here whereas people I know in other areas have.""
Rachel Brown and her husband Stuart says lockdown gave them a ""push"" to realise a long-held dream
Rachel Brown and her husband Stuart started their young children's gift box website An-Edit a year ago, while still holding down retail jobs as employees.
With Rachel on furlough and pregnant, she says it was ""probably the prime time to think about starting up"" her own business to realise a long-held dream.
""Lockdown gave us that push... [we thought] if we don't give it a go now then when would be the right time? It gave us focus and clarity,"" she says.
""It was also the type of business - people couldn't go out and look round the shops and we were offering nice gift sets and a personalised card - it was an easy one-stop shop for a gift.""
Promoting mainly on social media, lockdowns gave them a captive audience. People searched online for baby gifts which led customers to their website.
""[In the current situation] it's the companies that make things easier for customers that do well,"" Mr Brown says.

Ginny Cooper from the St Albans Enterprise Agency, which provides free one-to-one advice and training to prospective start-ups, says it is a ""very collaborative place"" to start a business with a large number of networking groups.
She said about 30% of people they had meetings with ended up starting their own businesses, and about two-thirds of them were women.
""Businesses that have done well in the last couple of years are ones that have helped people throughout the pandemic,"" she says."
Business,"Spring Statement: How have people received today's announcements?
The Chancellor of the Exchequer's Spring Statement has raised the amount people can earn before paying National Insurance and cut fuel by 5p a litre.
Rishi Sunak faced pressure to act as household budgets are squeezed amid soaring energy costs and rising household bills due to increasing inflation.
The VAT rate on hospitality, food and non-alcoholic beverage sales was already set to rise to 20% - from 12.5% - on 1 April and businesses were hoping Mr Sunak was going to change his mind and keep it at the lower rate. He did not and many fear they will not survive.
'It's the economics of the madhouse'
Charles Bunker from the Orchard Tea Garden, Grantchester says a 20% VAT rate could end his business
The proprietor of the Orchard Tea Garden in Grantchester, near Cambridge said he met the chancellor's statement with ""absolute fury beyond belief"".
Charles Bunker says a 20% VAT rate could end his business. During the lockdowns, he was only able to trade for 17 weeks last year and shut down four times, losing stock every time.
""I don't know how a chancellor can up VAT by 60% on businesses like mine, while the banks are getting a 60% reduction in their tax,"" he says.
""I am going to have to find an extra £55,000 a year if I don't put up my prices.""
The changes Mr Sunak has made to the National Insurance threshold and business rates will help him by £10,000 over the year but that still leaves him £45,000 out of pocket.
He says his business is already ""suffering from hyperinflation"" over the past year which has been ""quite staggering"".
Flour has gone up 90% and sugar by 52% - plus his heating bill is about to go from an average of £1,400 a month to £3,000 and staff costs have ""gone through the roof"", he says.
Mr Bunker says he currently charges £8.80 for a cream tea but upping his prices in order to ""absorb these costs without moving into a loss"" plus a rise in VAT would take the price to just over £10, which he says is ""unsustainable"".
""I do not believe that over £10.00 for a cream tea is sustainable in this business when people are between £300 and £500 a month worse off,"" he said.
""My product becomes unaffordable, it's completely barking, it's the economics of the madhouse.""
Justin Kempson, sales director at Charpak, was worried about the cost of living increases affecting his business
Justin Kempson, sales and innovation director at Huntingdon packaging company Charpak, says he can see the cost of living crisis affecting business.
The company, which has been designing and making sustainable packaging for food and retail for more than 30 years, saw its energy costs triple last October.
""That's had a massive impact on profitability, I would say 80% of our profit of the last three months of the year was wiped out by those increased prices,"" he says.
Materials have doubled in price in some cases which also has an impact on food price inflation because products will ""cost more on the shelf"", he says.
Mr Kempson says he did not expect the government to do anything in terms of monetary support but he was looking for help with ""ease of access to cheaper finance"" and ""government-backed loans"".
""He did make some sort of announcement about tax relief on business investment but I will need to see what that means for small and medium-sized businesses before making comment,"" he says.
""The National Insurance announcement is good for our employees but there was not a lot for businesses.""
Sam McEvoy's family have already made cuts to their household expenditure
German language teacher, Sam McEvoy, from Norwich, welcomed the ""small price decrease"" in fuel duty but says other issues meant the bills would remain high.
""We'll be paying for the pandemic and things that are happening world-wide for a long, long time, I think,"" she says.
The teacher has started cycling to work as petrol is still ""too expensive"", and she could not rely on public transport.
""Obviously there are a lot of people who have to use the car, maybe disabled people,"" she says.
Her family has already made changes to its household expenditure, cutting back on eating out from every week to ""once, maybe twice a month"".
""We used to get a Hello Fresh subscription every month, eating healthily,"" says Ms McEvoy.
""We can't afford that now... food shopping has definitely increased.""
Pam Lee worries how her adult children are dealing with the rise in the cost of living
Part-time optometrist Pam Lee, who lives in Lower Gresham in north Norfolk, says she was in a ""quite fortunate"" position as all her children had now left home.
""It's just me and my husband and we're alright. We don't have a mortgage,"" she says, but she worries how her children will cope with additional costs.
""One of my daughter's has to pay for childcare and that's expensive,"" she says.
""And salaries are not going up in line with the extra expenses. Obviously she has to have petrol to get to work, and the food bills, heating... I worry about their future, they've got it far more difficult than I had.
""They're repaying their university loans whereas I had a grant... and could buy a house straight away.
""I don't think a lot of younger people can get on the housing ladder without the help of the bank of Mum and Dad and a deposit,"" adds Mrs Lee.
Speaking after his Spring Statement Rishi Sunak said: ""I can't protect everyone from all the global challenges we face, [but] the policies announced today will put billions of pounds back into the pockets of hard-working families.""
The key announcements in the Chancellor's statement have been criticised by the main opposition parties.
Shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, accused Mr Sunak of not understanding the ""scale of the challenge"" facing families and households.
She said the Labour Party's windfall tax policy would have allowed the government to cut VAT on energy bills and make support for vulnerable people more generous.
The leader of the Liberal Democrats said the Spring Statement had been a ""total swindle"" with the chancellor ""giving with one hand and taking with another"".
Sir Ed Davey said the Lib Dems would have provided a much bigger one-off cut in VAT, costing the Treasury £18bn, but giving household £600 to ""help reflate the economy""."
Business,"BA in talks over short-haul Gatwick flights
British Airways is considering plans for a short-haul flight operation at Gatwick Airport.
The airline confirmed it was working with unions on the proposals but said it would not comment further.
The British Airline Pilots Association told the BBC British Airways and the union were in the ""final stages of negotiations"" over pay and conditions.
Acting general secretary Martin Chalk said the union ""cautiously"" welcomed the airline's decision.
Mr Chalk said the move would ""create a number of much needed new pilot jobs"".
""We hope to bring these talks to a conclusion shortly,"" he added.
The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story, said the airline was looking to create a new unit at London Gatwick, after it halted its short-haul flights from the airport at the start of the coronavirus pandemic.
The paper reported carriers such as British Airways have typically relied on short-haul operations to feed traffic onto more profitable longer routes.
Last month, British Airways owner IAG said it was ramping up its flight schedules as global air travel restrictions are eased.
IAG said it would operate at about 45% of passenger capacity between July and September compared with pre-Covid levels, possibly rising to 75% by the end of 2021.
The company, which also owns Aer Lingus and Iberia, revealed a loss of more than €2bn (£1.7bn) in the six months to the end of June.
In April 2020, British Airways announced it would cut up to 12,000 jobs in response to the Covid crisis."
Business,"NHS blood test tube shortage set to worsen
NHS England has admitted that a shortage of vials used for blood tests will worsen over the next few weeks and will last until mid-September.
It said supplies remain constrained and are forecast ""to become even more constrained over the coming weeks"".
While the NHS expects the position to improve by the middle of next month, ""overall supply is likely to remain challenging for a significant period.""
Doctors had been told to stagger some blood tests due to the shortage.
They are warning that patient care will suffer due to delays.
It comes after Becton Dickinson, a company that makes vials for the health service, said it is experiencing serious supply chain issues.
Due to the shortage, the NHS has temporarily stopped some blood testing for fertility, pre-diabetes, allergies and certain blood disorders.
NHS England issued guidance urging doctors to delay regular blood tests if clinically safe and NHS Wales issued similar guidance.
In its guidance, NHS England said ""alternative products are being sought to alleviate these constraints,"" as a result of the global shortages of blood tube products.
Dr Farah Jameel, a GP based in north London and a representative from the British Medical Association trade body said she was having ""difficult conversations"" with patients about rationing the vials ""among the very sickest"".
Dr Jameel is having ""incredibly challenging"" conversations with patients about delayed blood tests.
She said there has been ""very unclear messaging from NHS England on how quickly we're going to run short and what the impact will be on patient care.""
""The NHS needs to communicate clearly with the public and with the profession so there is a clear understanding of the problems which will help us manage expectations,"" Dr Jameel said.
""These tests are a fundamental part of patient care, giving us essential insights into different conditions, warning signs and overall health.""
Preventative care
Doctor Gavin Jamie, an GP based in Swindon agreed that preventative care is going to be slower, in addition to screening delays cause by the pandemic which he said he's still trying to catch up on.
""We've not seen the full effect yet but it looks like it could carry on for at least a few months from the time scale NHS England have been giving us,"" he added.
GPs across the country have tweeted about the difficulties the shortage is causing, while patients have tweeted texts from their surgeries which have said their blood tests have been cancelled.
Alison Webb's blood tests have been delayed by four months due to the shortages
Alison Webb, from Wales, told the BBC she was told that she can't have her yearly thyroid and cholesterol checked due to the blood tube shortages. She has a condition which means the thyroid gland does not produce enough hormones and said her blood tests are currently overdue by four months.
""Now I've been told to ring again in a month's time. Terrible,"" she said.
The medical device company, Becton Dickinson, which partly manufactures its tubes in the US, said the need to test Covid-19 patients in addition to routine testing for procedures which were delayed due to the pandemic had increased demand.
Responding to the new NHS guidance, the British Medical Association said that healthcare staff were ""still no closer to understanding how this situation was able to develop and why there wasn't a contingency plan"".
""Today's guidance does not explain what will happen if hospitals or GP surgeries do run out of stock, and this must be addressed as a matter of urgency,"" said Dr David Wrigley, deputy chair of BMA council.
""No doctor wants the consequence of delayed diagnosis for patients due to these shortages, and they also need to know they are protected from any possible negligence claims,"" he added.
Supply problems
Like many other industries, Becton Dickinson said in addition to increased demand, it was experiencing ""continued transportation challenges"", which included port and transport capacity, air freight capacity and UK border challenges.
""Suppliers are also challenged to meet increased demand for raw materials and components,"" the firm told the BBC.
""We are balancing the frequency of preventive maintenance leading to plant shutdown to provide continuing supply of products, and we are working closely with our raw material suppliers, transport agencies and other necessary third parties to minimize supply disruptions,"" a spokesperson added.
A spokesperson for the Department for Health and Social Care told the BBC: ""Patient safety and continuity of care is our priority and we are working to ensure there is minimal possible impact on patient care.
""The health and care system is working closely with Becton Dickinson to put mitigations in place to resolve any problems if they arise,"" they added.
Diabetes UK expressed concerns for the 13.6 million people in the country at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The symptoms of type 2 diabetes can develop more slowly than those for type 1.
Nikki Joule, policy manager at the charity, said the supply issues would make the condition ""harder to spot"" and said it's ""very important"" that those at risk ""do not fall through the cracks due to a logistical issue.""
Gwenda Burns, chief executive of Fertility Network UK agrees that the logistical issue is ""extremely worrying"" for those awaiting fertility tests."
Business,"Food firm in 'drastic' action amid driver shortage
A company which supplies food to care homes and restaurants says it is taking ""drastic action"" to try to get round the shortage of UK lorry drivers.
The boss of Country Range said the group was buying smaller vans in the face of ""significant"" problems caused by a lack of qualified HGV drivers.
Managing director Coral Rose said the issue was ""going to get worse"" as schools and offices return to normal.
Industry warnings about the impact of driver shortages have been increasing.
On Wednesday, both Tesco and Iceland said there could be some shortages on the shelves in the run up to the key Christmas trading period.
Supermarket bosses warn over Christmas supplies
Act now to end lorry driver crisis, government told
How serious is the HGV driver shortage?
A combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors has meant there are not enough drivers to meet demand.
The Road Haulage Association estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000.
That number included tens of thousands of drivers from EU member states who were living and working in the UK. Even before Covid, the estimated shortage was about 60,000 drivers.
'Increased pressure'
Country Range is a group of 12 wholesalers supplying food and non-food items to schools, care homes, hotels, restaurants and small shops.
Ms Rose said the shortage of drivers had affected both the supply of products from manufacturers to its warehouses and also from its warehouses to its customers.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Rose said Country Range was ""taking drastic action such as buying smaller delivery vehicles to make sure that we don't have to have people with specific HGV licences to drive them"".
There was ""going to be increased pressure as schools reopen, people continue to holiday in the UK, people return back to their offices, so staff feeding may reopen again, so the issue is going to get worse and we would like government intervention"", she added.
One short-term fix the government could take would be to a temporary visa scheme ""to encourage EU workers to come back"", she said.
But she wants the government to give support for people with training and apprenticeships in the longer term ""because this is not a quick fix, it's a long-term issue"".
Ms Rose also said: ""There's lot of drivers who are able to drive but can't go on the road at the moment because they couldn't take their tests or refresher course and training through the last year because of Covid, so there's potential to release a lot more drivers. There could be some increased resource in that area as well and that would help.""
On Wednesday, the government said there was a ""highly resilient"" food supply chain and it was taking measures to tackle the driver shortage.
Labour's shadow minister for business and consumers, Seema Malhotra, said: ""The chaos hitting supply chains is of the Conservatives' making. Their failure to keep their promise to cut red tape for businesses, which are struggling with more paperwork and higher costs, combined with worker shortages, has created a perfect storm.""
The government said it had ""well-established ways of working with the food sector to address food supply chain disruptions"".
A spokesperson added the government had announced measures to tackle driver shortages, which included streamlining and increasing tests.
""Most of the solutions are likely to be driven by industry, with progress already being made in testing and hiring, and a big push towards improving pay, working conditions and diversity,"" they added.
""We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad.""
What have the supermarkets said?
Sainsbury's said ""availability in some product categories may vary but alternatives are available and stores continue to receive deliveries daily"".
Morrisons said it was working with suppliers to minimise shortages. It said it had ""contingency plans around Brexit in place for a number of years"". It added it was ""less concerned"" about some fresh foods because it produced them itself. However, it said the ""challenges"" had been exacerbated by summer holidays meaning fewer drivers were available. ""But there is no short-term fix for the haulage industry with drivers and vacancies increasing nationally.""
Waitrose said it had been ""working through the same challenges that all supermarkets are facing right now"". It added it was focussing on ""maintaining the best possible range of products"".
Iceland Foods, said: ""We are currently facing a massive shortage of HGV drivers in the UK which is impacting the food supply chain on a daily basis. We... have already seen deliveries to our stores cancelled for the first time since the pandemic began, and this is solely due to the HGV driver shortage.""
The Co-op said: ""Like many retailers, we are impacted by some patchy disruption to our deliveries, logistics and store operations but we are working closely with our suppliers to get re-stocked quickly.""
Tesco said ""there may be some shortages"", but people should not ""over-dramatise"" and panic-buy. ""It's very easy to make a drama out of a modest crisis.""
The motor industry has already reported that van sales have hit near record levels in 2021 as a result of a boom in home deliveries and the economy reopening.
Ms Rose admitted that a firm such as Country Range buying more small delivery vans would increase the number of vehicles on the roads. ""More vehicles and more staff required to do that, it's not an ideal scenario but it's something that we're trying to do to continue to supply our customers.""
She said steps were needed in order to encourage people to take up driving jobs. ""We need to make this an attractive profession and a recognised profession, not just with food service but within the whole of the UK.
""The average age of the drivers is over 55 - there isn't a lot of new blood coming into the industry because it takes time and money to train and people don't necessarily have that.""
'A perfect storm'
Staff shortages in the food industry are extending beyond drivers.
Bolton-based Greenhalgh's Craft Bakery has a chain of shops in Greater Manchester and Lancashire, and delivers wholesale nationally.
Six members of the firm's management team have been taking turns to do shifts driving the delivery vans.
Boss David Smart told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""It's a bit of a perfect storm really. We are short of drivers but it isn't just drivers, we're actually short of quite a few people throughout the business from bakers to bakery operatives to shop colleagues to drivers to office staff.
""It's the August bank holiday, everybody wants to go everywhere and because we're a food service industry we try to supply all those areas. We're extremely busy. However, we are very, very busy with too few hands."""
Business,"Sports Direct owner's new boss offered potential £100m bonus
Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has offered the retail tycoon's future son-in-law a £100m bonus - but only if he can more than double the share price.
The Sports Direct owner has put forward the bonus plan for Michael Murray when he becomes chief executive in May 2022.
However, he will only collect if its share price reaches £15 for 30 trading days in a row before October 2025, up from its current level of about £6.50.
The company described the target as ""challenging but achievable"".
Mr Murray, 31, engaged to be married to Mr Ashley's daughter Anna, is currently ""head of elevation"" at Frasers and is in charge of modernising stores and transforming the business.
The board of Frasers Group, which owns Sports Direct and House of Fraser, said it had also recommended £1m a year salary for Mr Murray.
Shareholders are set to vote on the proposed bonus scheme at the group's annual general meeting on 29 September.
Mike Ashley: Who is the founder of Sports Direct?
Mr Ashley is due to step down as chief executive when Mr Murray takes over, but will remain on the board as an executive director.
Mr Ashley founded Sports Direct in 1982 and retains 64% of the group.
The company listed its shares on the stock exchange in 2007, with shares priced at 300p. Prices surged to more than 900p in early 2014.
Worries over corporate governance and working conditions, as well as the impact of Covid on retailers, have since hit the share price.
The group was renamed Frasers in December 2019, following its takeover of House of Fraser, but stores retained the Sports Direct brand.
Sports Direct promised in 2016 to end zero-hours contracts and offer its workers guaranteed hours, but unions have since accused the company of breaking that pledge.
The firm has attracted criticism for continuing to recruit workers on zero-hours contracts during the pandemic.
Mike Ashley will remain on the Frasers Group board after stepping down as chief executive
""The board believes that the significant increase in value of the shares to be achieved before Michael's share option award vests is suitably challenging but achievable and would be evidence of the success of the group's elevation strategy and Michael's leading role in this,"" the company said.
Mr Murray has been working for the group for several years, but his role at the company raised eyebrows after reports about him being paid millions of pounds in consultancy fees.
Mr Ashley was previously executive deputy chairman of the retail group - which changed its name from Sports Direct International to Frasers Group two years ago - until 2016, when long-serving chief executive Dave Forsey resigned.
Mr Ashley, 56, has been one of the High Street's most prominent and colourful figures since founding his business."
Business,"Data protection 'shake-up' takes aim at cookie pop-ups
The UK's new Information Commissioner will be charged with a post-Brexit ""shake up"" of data rules, including getting rid of cookie pop-ups.
John Edwards has been named the next head of data regulator the ICO.
The government said Mr Edwards, currently the New Zealand Privacy Commissioner, would ""go beyond the regulator's traditional role"".
The job would now be ""balanced"" between protecting rights and promoting ""innovation and economic growth"".
Mr Edwards has been named as the government's preferred candidate, and said it is a ""great honour"".
""I look forward to the challenge of steering the organisation and the British economy into a position of international leadership in the safe and trusted use of data for the benefit of all,"" he said.
His predecessor, current Commissioner Elizabeth Denham, said Mr Edwards ""will take on a role that has never been more important or more relevant to people's lives.""
The government's shake-up of the Information Commissioner's Office was announced alongside planned changes to data protection post-Brexit.
""Light touch""
In an interview with The Telegraph newspaper, Digital Secretary Oliver Dowden said the plans include getting rid of ""endless"" cookie pop-ups which are common on most large sites, asking for permission to store a user's personal information.
This is widely marketed as a tool for compliance with EU data law the GDPR, although the practice pre-dates it.
He told the newspaper that ""high risk"" sites would still need similar notices, but that many of them are ""pointless"".
And he said reform of data protection rules is ""one of the big prizes of leaving"" the EU.
""There's an awful lot of needless bureaucracy and box ticking and actually we should be looking at how we can focus on protecting people's privacy but in as light a touch way as possible,"" he said.
Media caption,
The proposed reforms extend to all sorts of data.
In the official announcement, the government said it will prioritise making new ""data adequacy"" partnerships that will allow it to send people's personal data internationally, to places such as the United States, Korea, Singapore, Dubai and Colombia, among others.
Data adequacy in this sense means an agreement that the protections in place are similar in two countries, with the idea of ensuring that personal information remains safe. It is a key part of EU regulations and was a minor sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.
EU approves data flow to UK but adds sunset clause
No-deal Brexit - the data dilemma
The UK currently has a data adequacy agreement with the EU, though it needs to be renewed in future and could change if the law in the UK diverges too far from EU rules.
Other details remain light, with the government promising to launch a consultation on what future data laws will look like.
The government said that as much as £11bn of trade ""goes unrealised around the world due to barriers associated with data transfers"".
""Now that we have left the EU I'm determined to seize the opportunity by developing a world-leading data policy that will deliver a Brexit dividend for individuals and businesses across the UK,"" Mr Dowden said.
""It means reforming our own data laws so that they're based on common sense, not box-ticking.""
Andrew Dyson, a data protection expert at law firm DLA Piper, said these announcements amounted to the ""first evidence"" of ""a bold new regulatory landscape for digital Britain post-Brexit"".
""It will be interesting to see the further announcements that are sure to follow on reforms to the wider policy landscape that are just hinted at here,"" he said.
This is a big moment in the evolution of the UK's data protection policies.
As New Zealand's Privacy Commissioner, John Edwards showed he was anything but timid in taking on the tech giants. After the Christchurch massacre, he described Facebook ""as morally bankrupt pathological liars who enable genocide (Myanmar), [and] facilitate foreign undermining of democratic institutions"" - in a tweet he later deleted.
The current commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has been criticised by some privacy campaigners for not being robust enough in protecting data rights. But it looks as though the government wants her replacement to be even more cautious.
Mr Edwards ""will be empowered to go beyond the regulator's traditional role of focusing only on protecting data rights, with a clear mandate to take a balanced approach that promotes further innovation and economic growth.""
That looks like a clear signal that the interests of those businesses complaining about the burden of what they regard as excessive data regulations will be given a hearing.
Oliver Dowden's told the Daily Telegraph that EU rules on cookies - which, by the way, predate the GDPR data laws - could be the first target of the new slimmed down approach to regulation. With many web users frustrated by the constant need to click ""accept"" on cookie banners every time they visit a new site, this could prove a popular move.
But data protection specialists warn that it's easy to generate headlines about a bonfire of regulations, much harder to frame new laws diverging from what applies across the English Channel.
And the tech companies themselves may complain about EU data laws - but may see this as just adding another layer of complexity to their global policies, rather than a big opportunity.

Business,"OnlyFans suspends policy change after backlash
OnlyFans has announced that it will delay making changes to policy on content creation, following a widespread backlash by its users.
The content subscription service announced plans last week to block sexually explicit photos and videos from October.
On Wednesday, it tweeted that it has ""suspended the planned 1 October policy change"".
It is currently unclear if the delay will be permanent.
OnlyFans wrote on twitter that it would ""continue to provide a home for all creators"".
""Thank you to everyone for making your voices heard,"" said the company.
""We have secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned 1 October policy change.
""OnlyFans stands for inclusion and we will continue to provide a home for all creators.""
And in an email to its content creators, it said: ""The proposed 1 October 2021 changes are no longer required, due to banking partners' assurances that OnlyFans can support all genres of creators. ""OnlyFans is committed to providing a safe and dependable platform for all creators and their fans.""
One OnlyFans creator, from London, welcomed the announcement but said those who had already found new homes for their content may still not return.
""So it is short-term good news for sex workers reliant on the platform - and I would like to see this as the start of increased support, celebration and championing of sex-worker rights by OnlyFans,"" he told BBC News.

""But I think there may well have been enough anxiety caused to see many models continuing the move to other platforms.""
OnlyFans makes its money by taking 20% of all payments made to its content creators.
The platform reported a 75% increase in new creators in May last year, during lockdown.
Wariness from investors was originally claimed to be the reason for last week's announcement.
But founder Tim Stokely blamed banks penalising the company for supporting sex workers.
""JPMorgan Chase is particularly aggressive in closing accounts of sex workers or...  any business that supports sex workers,"" he told the Financial Times on Tuesday.
But a JPMorgan spokeswoman told BBC News it had ""no such policy"".
In June, a BBC News investigation found children had used fake ID to set up accounts on the site.
And the children's commissioner for England said OnlyFans needed to do more to stop under-age users.
In response to the investigation, OnlyFans said it had closed the accounts flagged and refunded all active subscriptions."

Zoom has announced that it will adopt a hybrid approach as it prepares for a return to office working.
It said an internal survey of employees found only 1% wanted to return to the office full-time.
The pandemic spurred huge growth for the video calls platform, with sales in the last three months of 2020 up 370% compared with the same period in 2019.
The company said it would strategically mix remote and in-office working, but admitted that it was ""not easy"".
Zoom's employee poll found that more than half of its staff preferred a hybrid approach, with the remainder favouring or already working fully remotely.
Writing on a company blog, chief financial officer Kelly Steckelberg said it was ""still experimenting with how that even looks"".
""We opened our Sydney, Australia, office this summer, but temporarily closed it soon after, as Covid-19 threatened the area. We plan to reopen again when it is safe, but this could impact plans to reopen a second location this fall [autumn],"" she wrote.

Business,"Amigo warns of collapse as losses jump and compensation payouts rise
Money lender Amigo is warning it may not survive after revealing it faces a £345m compensation bill for mis-selling claims.
The business, which lends money to people with poor credit records, also revealed a jump in annual losses to £284m, compared with £38m last year.
In May, the High Court rejected its plan to set aside a separate pot of money for compensation.
Amigo had faced a deluge of complaints the company had mis-sold them loans.
The company, which offered loans with an interest rate of up to 49.9%, was forced to stop lending last year after thousands of complaints from customers who say they were approved for loans that they could never afford to repay.
A host of these complaints have come via claims management companies.
The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), says that a loan is unaffordable if making the repayments means someone has to borrow more money or get behind with essential bills.
Amigo has tried once to negotiate a settlement that would have seen those customers get pennies on the pound, but it was rejected by the High Court in May.
The company is preparing to present a new proposal to the FCA and the High Court. If this next offer is rejected, it is likely to go under.
Boardroom bust-ups and rows with the regulator have not helped but, fundamentally, Amigo is facing a challenge that has brought down other big names in the sector.
These results reveal the huge compensation bill it faces for historic mis-selling of loans. The influx of complaints for advancing money to people who had little chance of repaying has already spelled the end to Wonga and others.
If Amigo were to collapse, then plenty of borrowers will believe this is a company that has reaped what it sowed.
Yet, there will be concern too among those who struggle to borrow from mainstream lenders that their options continue to shrink.
In the results statement, which was originally due to be made in July, the company said there was a ""material uncertainty"" around its ability to continue as a going concern.
Gary Jennison, Amigo's chief executive said he was keen to save the company, as it offered essential finance to those who could not access mainstream lending.
""The issues of the past are real, but do not diminish the need in society for lenders like Amigo,"" he said.

Many companies perform better with overseas ownership according to business minister Lord Grimstone, who said the UK had nothing to fear from a recent flood of private foreign takeover bids for UK-listed companies.
""It would be a sad day for Britain if we pulled down the shutters so that we weren't a mercantile entrepreneurial country,"" he said.
His comments came as the government announced that the UK will hold a major international investment summit in October to attract more overseas investment in post-Brexit Britain.
""All our research shows that overseas invested companies are more productive and produce more jobs,"" added Lord Grimstone.
""It's an extraordinary finding but what it shows is the importance of attracting overseas investment into the UK.""
Recent figures show that foreign private buyers have spent more acquiring UK-listed business in the last eight months than they have in the last five years combined.
Currently, grocery company Morrisons and defence contractors Meggitt and Ultra are the subject of bidding wars between overseas investors.
Lord Grimstone, former deputy chairman of Barclays, which will be a major sponsor of the upcoming summit, said the UK was at the forefront of industries of the future, including renewable energy and the convergence of finance and technology - so-called fintech.
He also pointed to the £1bn investment in new car and battery production recently announced by Nissan.
""We intend to keep the UK as one of the most attractive destinations for foreign investment in the world,"" he said.
""We are in that category but I like to think of investment as one of the most globally competitive sports and we intend to win in it.""
Despite the flood of recent private takeovers, overall foreign direct investment into the UK has fallen every year since the Brexit referendum in 2016, and the UK which attracted more investment than any other country in Europe for 18 years in a row, lost that title to France in both of the last two years."
Business,"McDonald's runs out of milkshakes in England, Scotland and Wales
McDonald's has run out of milkshakes and some bottled drinks at restaurants in England, Scotland and Wales.
The fast-food chain said it was facing supply chain issues affecting the availability of shakes and bottled drinks at its 1,250 outlets.
An updated statement said it was ""working hard"" to limit the impact on deliveries and customers and had taken some items off its menus for now.
It confirmed the lorry driver shortage was one reason behind the disruption.
Its statement said: ""As reported, a number of issues are impacting retailers in the UK at the moment, one of which is the nationwide shortage of HGV drivers.""
A wide range of businesses have reported problems with supplies because of the driver shortage.
Last week, Nando's closed some outlets after running out of chicken.
Earlier this month, a survey by the Road Haulage Association (RHA) estimated there was a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, out of a pre-pandemic total of about 600,000.
Bonus payments
The RHA has said some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, adding that a ""historic"" shortage in drivers had been exacerbated by changes to rules following Brexit.
More recently, drivers being told to self-isolate after being notified by the NHS Covid app have also added to the problem.
Act now to end lorry driver crisis, government told
How serious is the HGV driver shortage?
Analysis of the latest ONS Labour Force Survey for the second quarter suggests that 14,000 EU lorry drivers left jobs in the UK in the year to June 2020, but only 600 had returned by July 2021.
Firms from a number of sectors in the UK have been battling with a supply chain crisis due to a shortage of lorry drivers. On Friday, Logistics UK, which represents freight firms, and the British Retail Consortium (BRC) wrote to the government to plead for new measures to alleviate the problem.
Tesco has been offering lorry drivers a £1,000 joining bonus amid a chronic shortage of drivers in the industry.
Other companies are also understood to be offering similar incentives for HGV drivers after disruption to supply chains led to product shortages. Morrisons said it was working on schemes to train staff to become lorry drivers.
A government spokesperson said last week it was bringing in a package of measures to help tackle the HGV driver shortage, including plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their HGV licence and to increase the number of tests that can be conducted.
Although famous for its Big Macs and fries, McDonald's is actually one of the biggest drinks retailers in the UK.
The shift towards McCafés and promotion of coffee sales was a deliberate policy in the last decade to try to bring in more customers outside of normal mealtimes.
But faced with supply chain issues, it has decided to prioritise its big sellers at the expense of milkshakes. Because every element of the burger needs to be present in the production line, those deliveries are being secured. Bottled drinks can sit in a warehouse much longer without going out of date.
The timing of this shortage coming in the summer holiday season has meant a higher number of customers will be disappointed at missing out on their milkshakes.
It has also temporarily relaxed drivers' hours rules to allow HGV drivers to make slightly longer journeys.
Other leading businesses have reported problems caused by driver shortages.
Last week, Nando's was forced to close about 50 of its restaurants after running out of chicken.
Rival KFC also warned recently that supply chain issues meant it was unable to stock some menu items.
Dairy giant Arla has had to cut back on milk deliveries to supermarkets because of a shortage of drivers, while sweet producer Haribo also reported problems resulting from a shortage of drivers.
Oil giant BP temporarily closed a ""handful"" of its UK sites because not enough unleaded petrol and diesel had been delivered.
McDonald's apologised for any inconvenience and thanked customers for their patience."
Business,"Bitcoin comes to UK PayPal - but not for payments
PayPal plans to expand its service internationally in the coming months
PayPal customers in the UK will now be able to use the platform to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency, with investments starting at £1.
But PayPal payments can still not be made in Bitcoin, for example, directly.
Instead, the cryptocurrency will have to be sold for traditional currency and its value then used to make a cash purchase.
PayPal is initially working with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.
But the currencies cannot be sent to friends or family or transferred to or from of any other digital wallet.
Entry point
PayPal launched its cryptocurrency service in the US, in October, hoping to make them more accessible to a wider audience.
But they remain volatile in value and unregulated - meaning investments are not protected by the authorities, if something goes wrong
""The tokens and coins have been around for a while but you had to be a relatively sophisticated user to be able to access that,"" a PayPal spokesman told CNBC.
""Having that on a platform like ours makes a really good entry point.""

Simon Peters, a crypto-asset analyst at trading platform eToro, said told BBC News: ""Having major reputable household names involved is good for consumers and good for the reputation of crypto more widely.""
Monetary policy
UK regulators have become increasingly wary of cryptocurrencies in recent months.
And in June, the Financial Conduct Authority banned Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, from conducting any ""regulated activity"" in the UK.
But on Monday, PayPal chief executive Dan Schulman told the Financial Times: ""I do believe that governments, central banks are understanding that the world is moving towards digital payments, that you cannot manage monetary policy through the issuance of banknotes.""
PayPal vice-president and general manager for blockchain, crypto and digital currencies Jose Fernandez da Ponte said: ""We are committed to continue working closely with regulators in the UK, and around the world, to offer our support - and meaningfully contribute to shaping the role digital currencies will play in the future of global finance and commerce. ""
And PayPal plans to expand its cryptocurrency service into further international territories in the coming months.
Bitcoin, the world's biggest digital currency, hit a record high of nearly $65,000 (£47,550) in April.
But when Chinese regulators extended a crackdown on the market, it tumbled to below $30,000.
It has since recovered, though, and rose above $50,000 on Monday, for the first time in three months.

Business,"Covid: Government warns Covid test firms over misleading prices
More than 80 private Covid travel test providers listed on the government's website will be issued two-strike warnings over misleading prices, Health Secretary Sajid Javid has announced.
A further 57 firms will be removed from the website on Monday, because they either no longer exist or do not actually provide the relevant tests.
The health secretary said the move was to clamp down on ""cowboy behaviour"".
The government will also introduce spot checks on the test providers.
Which countries are on the green list?
Anger at overflowing Covid test drop boxes
Tui to subsidise Covid tests for customers
The UK government has made it a condition of international travel to England that tests before travel, and on your arrival in the UK are mandatory.
The number of tests that are needed is dependent on your arrival from either a green or amber country or your vaccination status. Arrivals from red countries must still use quarantine hotel facilities.
The government website has a list of private companies that offer such tests - but a recent review by the Department of Health found the prices displayed were lower on the Gov.UK site than the actual amount they cost.
Some of the most common complaints from travellers also mention tests listed on the government's list of providers that do not exist at the price advertised, whilst others allege poor service.
Mr Javid said: ""It is absolutely unacceptable for any private testing company to be taking advantage of holidaymakers and today's action clamps down on this cowboy behaviour.
""57 firms will be removed from the Gov.UK list and a further 82 will be given a two-strike warning - if they advertise misleading prices ever again, they're off.""
He added that the spot checks being introduced were to ensure that all private providers ""follow the rules"" and meet the government's ""high standards of transparency"".
'We haven't met anyone who's had a £20 test'
But consumer group Which? said that it had warned the government about the problems with private travel test providers six months ago.
""It's welcome news that the government is finally taking responsibility for its list of test providers and carrying out an audit, but it's six months late,"" Rory Boland, travel editor at consumer association Which?, told the BBC.
Multiple advertisements for private Covid travel tests can now be seen on UK public transport
""There should not have been providers listed on the Gov.UK website that don't exist. We found this in our first investigation in April, when providers were telling us that the system would collapse if larger numbers of people were travelling.""
He added that Which? had repeatedly reported some Covid test providers to the government: ""In our second investigation, we looked at the 10 cheapest providers and we found that none of the tests listed below £80, were actually attainable for less than that.
""We submitted the names to the government and they removed three of those 10 names in June.""
While the government has not named the providers that it intends to remove from the Gov.UK website, or the firms that will be receiving warnings, Which? says it is certain that the test providers offering Covid tests that start from £20 will be targeted.
Mr Boland said: ""You can't get the £20 tests. We haven't met anyone who's had a £20 test. Generally the price you pay, at the cheaper end, is £40-£50.
""A lot of these firms offering £20 tests require you to drive to somewhere in England on a specific day, such as in Middlesbrough. When you try to book the test online, the booking calendar is almost always full.""
In April, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told MPs that some travel tests had fallen to below £45, saying he was ""very anxious"" to reduce the cost of the tests for consumers.
Last week, the Competition and Markets Authority's former chairman, Lord Tyrie, accused it of not doing enough to protect consumers, saying that PCR testing for travel had become a ""predictable Covid rip-off"".
In response, the business and competition regulator told the BBC it warned government officials that consumers could face risks from the fast-growing travel testing industry in April and May."
Business,"Edinburgh toy shop owner warned of stock shortages in Christmas run-up
Toy shop owner Donald Nairn has been warned to expect stock shortages in the run-up to Christmas.
Suppliers have told the Edinburgh businessman that a shortage of lorry drivers, among other problems linked to Brexit and Covid, are likely to have an impact.
He hopes he will have plenty of Christmas stock if he puts in orders now.
But business groups are calling for government action.
Lobby groups for the retail and transport industries have jointly written to UK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng warning that the impact on supply chains is getting worse.
They say a shortage of 90,000 HGV drivers ""is placing increasingly unsustainable pressure on retailers and their supply chains"".

Tesco offers £1,000 joining bonus for lorry drivers
How serious is the HGV driver shortage?
Mr Nairn, who has run Toys Galore in Morningside since 2005, said almost all his suppliers had emailed to warn of stock shortages as Christmas approaches.
""At least half of them have increased the prices they're charging us and although we'll do our best to absorb it, invariably there will be price rises, I think, in the second half of the year,"" he said.
Mr Nairn said they have told him they are having problems with container ships as their prices have gone up ""several-fold"".
""They're also having problems with delivery drivers and other knock-on effects from both Covid and Brexit,"" he added.
The government recently relaxed rules on driving hours to help solve the shortage of HGV drivers
He predicted that the shortages would involve toys from Asia as ""the logistical chain is that much longer"".
""We are basically ordering as much stock as we possibly can right now so we have stuff to sell at Christmastime,"" he said.
""Certain things I anticipate will be in incredibly short supply, like Barbies for example.
""It's very hard to pinpoint exactly where the problem is going to be but I think if we do as much as possible now, we should be in a reasonably good position going into Christmas, that said, there will be shortages.""
Similar problems are also affecting brewers and last week the Scottish Licensed Trade Association warned that some pubs in Scotland were on the brink of running out of beer due to distribution issues.
Ewan MacDonald-Russell, of the Scottish Retail Consortium, is raising concerns before it becomes a big issue
The shortage of lorry drivers has partly been caused by the pandemic, when recruitment and training paused, according to Ewan MacDonald-Russell, of the Scottish Retail Consortium.
He said about 25,000 HGV drivers who were EU nationals had also left the UK since Brexit.
""That's why we're seeing the odd gaps appearing [on shop shelves],"" he added.
""There's a little bit of disruption but it's important not to exaggerate that - there's plenty of supply at the moment but it's becoming more and more challenging all the time.
""We are raising concerns about it now before it becomes a huge issue.""
Temporary work visas
He said the industry wanted to see temporary work visas granted to EU drivers to plug the gap in the short term.
They also want to see improvements in support for training lorry drivers, and better Covid testing facilities so drivers can be tested daily.
A UK government spokesperson said: ""We recently announced a package of measures to help tackle the HGV driver shortage, including plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their HGV licence and to increase the number of tests able to be conducted.
""We have also temporarily relaxed drivers' hours rules to allow HGV drivers to make slightly longer journeys, but these must only be used where necessary and must not compromise driver safety."""
Business,"Gambling: Poorer UK towns found to have the most betting shops, study shows
A fifth of all gambling premises in the UK are now located in the poorest areas of the country, new research has found.
Betting shops are 10 times more likely to be found in deprived towns than in affluent areas, according to a study by the University of Bristol.
The areas with the highest number of betting shops per capita included Glasgow, Liverpool, London and Middlesbrough, the study found.
This comes amid the government's ongoing review of the Gambling Act.
A spokesman for the Gambling Commission - which is the government body that regulates gambling - said: ""Tackling gambling harm is a number one priority for the Gambling Commission.
""We will carefully consider the issues raised by any gambling-related research and any actions will be taken through the national strategy to reduce gambling harms.""
'I stole £70,000 to feed my gambling addiction'

'Women don't need to feel shame about gambling addiction'
Although the number has been declining in recent years, there were still more gambling sites in Britain than shops run by the big eight supermarket chains put together, said the study, which is supported by the Standard Life Foundation.
The research highlights a disproportion between the amenities available on local High Streets for people living in deprived communities, compared to the amenities available in more affluent areas.
For instance, just 10% of all food stores are located in the poorest areas, yet these places were home to as many as 34% of amusement arcades, 30% of bingo venues and 29% of adult gaming centres.
In contrast, more affluent towns and cities had a much more even spread of services like libraries and supermarkets, the research showed.
And half of UK gambling treatment centres can be found within a five-minute walk - 250 metres - of the nearest gambling premises, while nearly 10% of schools have a gambling venue within a five-minute walk - affecting 742,000 school pupils in more than 2,000 schools across the country.
""The research highlights the clear mismatch between the amenities available in 'left behind' areas, compared with those that are more affluent,"" said Jamie Evans, senior research associate at the University of Bristol.
""Rather than having greater access to the facilities, services and opportunities that help people to improve their lives, those in more deprived communities are disproportionately faced with choices that can often prove harmful. While the gambling industry may offer some much-needed employment in these areas, it usually takes much more than it gives, leaving a legacy of greater hardship and increased social problems.""
'Local communities have so little say'
Liz and Charles Ritchie started the Gambling With Lives charity after they lost their son Jack to suicide in 2017.
They say that currently at least 500 young people die every year, having had a gambling addiction.
Liz and Charles Ritchie's son Jack took his life in 2017. He began visiting betting shops during his school lunch break at age 17
""Predatory gambling companies target the poor and the young. We know the tragic cost of this targeting - at least one death per day,"" Ms Ritchie told the BBC.
""Many of the young people we have lost... were enticed into gambling premises very near schools or on their bus routes home.""
Mr Ritchie is concerned that the government is ""putting business before lives"".
""At the moment, local communities have so little say in opposing any planning,"" he said.
""We've been contacted by local communities who have had a terrible problem with this. People don't want betting shops.""
The couple want to see local authorities and communities given much greater power to veto licences for betting shops, particularly if they are close to schools and other facilities used by young people.
However the Betting and Gaming Council stressed that betting shops and casinos have made a ""huge economic contribution"" to the UK.
A spokesman for the Betting and Gaming Council said: ""BGC members support 119,000 jobs, generate £4.5bn in tax to pay for vital public services and contribute £7.7bn to the economy in gross value added.
""Betting shops alone employ around 46,000 people across the country, pay £1bn in tax to the Treasury as well as £60m in business rates for local councils, while casinos employ 11,000 staff and pay £500m a year in tax.""
The BBC understands that the government requires gambling premises to conduct local area risk assessments and explain how they are able to mitigate the risk of underage gambling.
But Mr Evans says this is not good enough: ""While gambling premises may provide jobs, we know that gambling can lead to a wide variety of financial, social and health problems, with problem gambling affecting not just the gambler themselves but many of those closest to them as well.
""These are problems which simply add to the many challenges that our most deprived communities already face."""
Business,"Apple delays recalling staff to the office until 2022
US tech giant Apple has delayed recalling staff to the office until January at the earliest amid fears over surging Covid cases.
Employees were informed of the decision in a company memo on Thursday, which was first reported by Bloomberg News.
The firm told staff it would reconfirm plans a month in advance and advised them to get vaccinated.
It is the latest US firm to revise its plans in the light of the impact of the Delta variant on the country.
Apple had previously called for staff to go back to the office by early September, before changing that to October.
When they are required to return, they will be expected to work at the office at least three days a week.
The company is also increasing its programme of Covid tests for staff at home to as many as three a week, Bloomberg reported.
Apple has made no official comment on the reports.
Rising cases
According to Bloomberg, Apple said it had no plans to shut down its offices or its retail stores.
However, the agency also said one Apple store in Charleston, North Carolina, had been closed after more than 20 employees either tested positive for Covid or had been exposed to the virus.
Some other US stores are said to have cut their opening hours because of sick or self-isolating staff.
Other big tech firms have been altering their return-to-work plans for employees as Covid cases rise in the US, with some stipulating that staff working in the office must be vaccinated.
Google has announced that it will delay a return to the office until 18 October.
The company has also joined Facebook in saying it will require US workers returning to the office to be vaccinated.
Twitter has paused its reopening, closing offices in San Francisco and New York once again.
The two Twitter offices had been operating at up to 50% capacity for staff who wanted to return.
Amid growing concern about the spread of the virus, the director of the National Institutes of Health, Dr Francis Collins, warned last weekend that the US could soon see Covid-19 cases return to 200,000 a day, a level last seen at the start of this year."
Business,"Why phone scams are so difficult to tackle
Phone fraud has soared during the pandemic
Many of us now refuse to answer telephone calls from an unknown number, for fear that it could be a scam.
And we dread receiving a text message, purportedly from our bank or a delivery firm, again due to concerns that it might be from fraudsters.
A recent report suggests that we are right to be cautious. In the 12 months to March 2021, phone call and text message fraud across England, Wales and Northern Ireland was up 83% from the previous year, according to consumer group Which?.
Which? analysed data from Action Fraud, the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cyber crime, and says this was the biggest rise across all types of fraudulent attacks.
It adds that the jump was fuelled by more people getting things delivered during the pandemic, which led to a corresponding huge rise in fake parcel delivery text notifications.
The rise in delivery text message fraud has soared as more of us have bought online
In these ""smishing"" attacks, fraudsters send a person a message, seemingly from a legitimate number, to claim that a small payment is needed before a package can be delivered. Then when you click on the link they try to steal your banking details.
But how exactly are the fraudsters able to do this, and why is it so difficult for telecoms firms and authorities to tackle the problem?
Matthew Gribben, a cyber security expert, says that criminals are able to make it look like their phone call or text is coming from the real telephone number of a bank or delivery firm, due to continuing vulnerabilities in the UK (and other countries') telephone network systems.
""There's no way for the current UK phone network to guarantee 100% that the presentation number it is being told is the actual originating number - it has to take your word for it,"" says Mr Gribben, who is a former consultant to GCHQ, the UK government intelligence agency.
The core of the problem is a telephone identification protocol called SS7, which dates back to 1975. It is a little complicated, but bear with us.
SS7 tells the telephone network what number a user is calling or texting from, known as the ""presentation number"". This is crucial so that calls can be connected from one to another. The problem is that fraudsters can steal a presentation number, and then link it to their own number.
The issue affects both landlines and mobile phones, with SS7 still central to the 2G and 3G parts of mobile phone networks that continue to carry our voice calls and text messages - even if you have a 5G-enabled handset.
One theory is that the vulnerabilities of SS7 cannot be fixed because the telecoms firms need to give national security agencies access to their networks, but Mr Gribben says GCHQ (Britain's intelligence agency) can monitor communications without using SS7 loopholes.
The problem, he says, is that SS7 is still used in telecoms networks globally. And it needs to be replaced rather than patched up.
Image caption,
Text messages, including this legitimate one and many two-factor authentication messages, are sent using old technology
""SS7 was developed assuming there would always be legitimate activity [and] goodwill around the use of it,"" explains Katia Gonzalez, head of fraud prevention and security at BICS, a Brussels-based telecoms firm that connects and protects mobile phone networks.
Phone scammers demand £1,000 to stop calling
Delivery text scams and how to deal with them
""There's too much legacy technology [reliant upon it] that we can't move away from - we're going to have these SS7 2G/3G networks for at least another 10 years.""
Jon France, head of industry security at the GSMA, the trade organisation that represents mobile network providers around the world, says that ""a lot of these problems will disappear"" after 5G networks have been fully rolled out. This will mean that SS7 - and 2G and 3G - can be totally replaced.
Ms Gonzalez agrees: ""It took some time to understand these flaws, and how they were exploited. Now with 5G there will be security from [the centre] of it.""
However, Mr Gribben cautions that even when SS7 is replaced by something ""entirely brand new and sparkling, there will still be other vulnerabilities [that fraudsters can exploit]"".
Experts say that when phone systems all go 5G, it will be much harder for fraudsters to hack them
The GSMA says that telecoms firms are putting ""a large amount of effort and investment"" into tackling scams.
For its part, BICS is using artificial intelligence systems to try to detect and block incoming fraudulent calls and texts.
Ms Gonzalez adds the only way to prevent text message scams is to enable telecoms firms to use AI to scan texts for links to fake websites before they are sent. Yet privacy regulators are unlikely to ever agree to that.
So instead BICS is calling for ""greater collaboration between telecoms firms and governments, better relations between countries, and more effort from the companies on sharing information on the latest vulnerabilities"".
New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape.
When it comes to fraudulent telephone calls, there has been a big increase in so-called ""robo-calling"" - automated voice calls in recent years.
Call authentication systems do exist that can help stop them, and the UK's telecommunications regulator Ofcom says it is consulting with the telecoms industry to see what can be implemented, and how soon.
""These criminal scams are becoming more sophisticated and tackling them requires efforts from a range of bodies,"" says an Ofcom spokesman.
""We're working closely with the police, industry and organisations such as NCSC [the National Cyber Security Centre] - which is responsible for cyber-security standards in the UK - to help tackle the problem.""
An international standards body, the US-based Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has also developed new protocols to prevent robo-calling.
In a nod to James Bond, the system is called ""Stir and Shaken"". US authorities have ordered mobile operators to implement the protocols by the end of 2021, but Ofcom says UK providers can't do so until networks are sufficiently upgraded, by 2025.
BICS’ Katia Gonzalez says that SS7 is here for another decade
As phone and text scams are not going away anytime soon, Amanda Finch, chief executive of professional body, Chartered Institute of Information Security, says: ""There's always more that telecoms firms could do"".
""But, security is a continually moving target... basically everyone has to be vigilant,"" she adds.
Meanwhile, Robert Blumofe, chief technology officer of cloud security firm Akamai, says: ""I don't think there's a world anytime soon where we can train people not to be fooled, so the solution has to include a way to block the response the text messages are trying to elicit."""

Business,"Morrisons backs US firm's improved £7bn takeover offer
Supermarket group Morrisons has accepted an improved £7bn takeover bid from US private equity group Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CD&R).
Morrisons had previously recommended investors accept a £6.7bn offer from a consortium led by another US-based investment group, Fortress.
Fortress said it was ""considering its options"", amid signs shareholders think the battle is not over.
Morrisons shares opened up on Friday, a signal investors expect another bid.
The retailer, which has almost 500 shops and more than 110,000 staff, has been at the centre of a takeover battle for weeks.
Fortress has urged Morrisons' shareholders to ""take no action"" on CD&R's agreed bid, which will require their approval at a meeting in October.
In July Morrisons turned down an offer worth £5.5bn from CD&R, saying it significantly undervalued the business.

But the grocer's board unanimously accepted the new offer, which represents a 60% premium to Morrisons' share price before takeover interest emerged in mid June.
Morrison shares rose 4.4% following the announcement to 291.4p per share.
Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that although the new offer has the backing of Morrisions' management, ""this might not be the end of the story"".
He said: Rival bidder Fortress has urged investors to hold fire on accepting the deal and are expected to make a further statement in due course. With the shares currently trading above the new and improved offer price, the market clearly thinks a better offer is a distinct possibility.""
'Protecting legacy'
Morrisons was founded in Bradford in 1899 - where it still has its headquarters. The founder William Morrison's son, the late Sir Ken Morrison, ran the business for fifty years.
CD&R said it recognises the ""legacy of Sir Ken Morrison, Morrisons' history and culture, and considers that this strong heritage is core to Morrisons and its approach to grocery retailing"".
The private equity firm said it would help Morrisons to build on its strengths, including its close relationships with suppliers and property portfolio.
Morrisons chairman Andrew Higginson said the offer ""represents good value for shareholders while at the same time protecting the fundamental character of Morrisons for all stakeholders"".
Over the last 10 years, CD&R has been advised by Sir Terry Leahy, who was the boss of Tesco at the time when Mr Higginson worked for him as chief financial officer.
Morrisons' chief operating officer, Trevor Strain, also previously worked with Sir Terry at Tesco.
Sir Terry also advised CD&R on its acquisition of discount retailer B&M, which netted the private equity firm an estimated profit of £1bn when it sold it on.
The future of the UK's fourth largest supermarket has taken a new twist.
Morrisons is one of a slew of UK companies that have been targeted by overseas investors. Defence contractors Meggit and Ultra are also the subject of bidding wars. The numbers are startling.
Even before you count Morrisons, Meggit and Ultra - foreign, private buyers have spent more buying UK listed companies in the last eight months than they have in the last five years combined.
UK companies look cheap to foreign buyers. The UK economy was one of the hardest hit by the pandemic - and the value of the pound has never quite recovered its pre-Brexit value which reduces the price of UK businesses for non-UK investors.
Some say that these bids highlight the value of - and confidence in - UK plc. But others are concerned that private buyouts increase debt levels, reduce transparency and mean that key decisions about the future of UK companies like Morrisons could be taken in New York rather than Bradford.
The UK government has already asked the Competition and Markets Authority to review the bid for submarine technology specialist Ultra on grounds of National Security and it may yet intervene in the takeover bid for aerospace specialist Meggitt.
There is also legislation planned to expand its powers to intervene and increase the scrutiny of privately held companies but for now there is a rush to the checkout for important chunks of UK PLC."
Business,"OnlyFans to ban sexually explicit content
The subscription site OnlyFans, known for its adult content, has announced it will block sexually explicit photos and videos from 1 October.
People will still be able to post nude content on the site.
But this will need to be consistent with OnlyFans' policies.
The announcement comes after BBC News had approached the company for a response to leaked documents concerning accounts which posted illegal content.
OnlyFans said the change had come after pressure from banking partners.
The site has grown during the pandemic and says it has 130 million users.
""In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of our platform, and continue to host an inclusive community of creators and fans, we must evolve our content guidelines,"" OnlyFans said in a statement.
The children selling explicit videos on OnlyFans
Under the skin of OnlyFans
Model Demi Rose: 'I'm finally taking control'
The London-based social media site enables its creators to post nude videos and photos and charge subscribers for tips or a monthly fee.
Creators can post a range of content from cooking to fitness videos, but it is best known for pornography.
In return for hosting the material, OnlyFans takes a 20% share of all payments.
The documents - described as ""compliance manuals"" - show that although illegal content itself is removed, OnlyFans lets moderators give creators multiple warnings before closing accounts.
Moderation specialists and child protection experts say this shows OnlyFans has some ""tolerance"" for accounts posting illegal content.
In response to the BBC's investigation, OnlyFans said the documents are not manuals or ""official guidance"", it does not tolerate violations of its terms of service, and its systems and age verification go far beyond ""all relevant global safety standards and regulations"".
The site, founded in 2016 by Essex businessman Tim Stokely, has come under fire in the past after a BBC News investigation found under-18s had used fake identification to set up accounts on the site. In June, BBC News found that under-18s sold explicit videos on the site, despite it being illegal for people to share indecent images of children.
After the BBC investigation, the children's commissioner for England said OnlyFans needed to do more to stop underage users. In response to the investigation, OnlyFans said it had closed the accounts flagged and refunded all active subscriptions.
In July, the company's first monthly transparency report said that it deactivated 15 OnlyFans accounts after finding indecent images of children on those accounts."
Business,"In Brazil, your internet provider may be a mobster, cops say
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 28 (Reuters) - As Rio de Janeiro residents sheltered at home last year during the deadliest phase of Brazil's COVID-19 outbreak, police detective Gabriel Ferrando said he got a tip that something suspicious was upending local internet service.
Access had vanished across broad swaths of Morro da Formiga, or Ant Hill, a tough neighborhood on the city's north side. When Ferrando quizzed a technician from broadband provider TIM SA tasked with fixing the outage, the worker, whom he declined to name, said armed men had chased him away with a warning not to return.
Turns out a new internet provider had claimed this turf: a company whose investors at one time included an accused drug and arms trafficker with alleged ties to Brazil's notorious Red Command crime syndicate, according to Ferrando, court documents filed by authorities and business registration records viewed by Reuters. Using stolen equipment, some of it pilfered from TIM, the newcomers soon had their own internet service up and running, Ferrando said. Residents could sign up with the new firm, he said - or do without.
TIM, a unit of Telecom Italia SpA (TLIT.MI), declined to comment, referring all inquiries to Brazil's telecom industry association Conexis. In a statement, the group called on the nation's law enforcement to act to protect legitimate operators.
Ferrando, a veteran of Rio's top organized crime unit, is trying to do just that. In a sealed report documenting months of investigation, he asked Rio state prosecutors in February to pursue charges against the purported pirates. The prosecutors' office did not respond to a request for comment. No charges have been filed.
Morro da Formiga isn't the only community reporting troubles. Reuters interviewed nearly two dozen telecom industry executives, law enforcement officials, technicians, academics and internet customers in Brazil, and reviewed thousands of pages of court filings submitted by police.
The people and documents described an audacious takeover of internet service in dozens of neighborhoods in Brazil's major cities by companies associated with alleged criminals unafraid to use force and intimidation to push out rivals. The result, these sources said, is that tens of thousands of Brazilians now depend on unreliable, second-rate broadband networks estimated by industry and law enforcement officials to be generating millions of dollars annually for purported crooks.
Bootleg providers can be unresponsive when service crashes and impatient when a bill is missed, some customers told Reuters. In Rio's working-class Campo Grande neighborhood, a resident described how someone knocks on his door monthly to collect 35 reais ($6.80) - in cash.
There's ""pressure to pay on the day that they choose with no delay,"" said the customer, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.
It's a reliable revenue stream made all the more lucrative by the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced families online for school, work and shopping. In 2020 alone, the proportion of Brazilian households with an internet connection grew by more than 12 percentage points to 83%, according to the most recent data available from Cetic.br, an information technology organization.
Pirates are plundering equipment and infrastructure, too, much of it re-purposed for their makeshift networks, authorities and telecom executives said. Theft and destruction of telecommunications gear rose 34% in 2020 from 2019, representing about 1 billion reais ($194 million) in direct annual losses, according to Feninfra, an industry group whose members include installers and repair workers. It said that figure rose another 16% in the first half of 2021.
THE ALLEGED SCHEME
Brazil's telecom industry is not alone in its struggles. Crime groups for years have controlled distribution of cooking gas, jugs of drinking water and other basics in many low-income urban neighborhoods. read more
But by building their own broadband networks, Brazil's criminals are raising their sophistication, according to more than 20 technicians, industry representatives and law enforcement officials interviewed by Reuters. They said the scheme typically works like this:
First, thieves steal or vandalize equipment belonging to traditional broadband operators. When repair teams arrive, they are menaced by armed men who warn them not to come back. Last year in Rio alone, no-go zones rose to 105 locations for Oi SA (OIBR4.SA), one of Brazil's largest internet providers. That figure has quadrupled since 2019, according to data supplied by the company.
Shortly after service is interrupted, telecom companies associated with organized crime groups set up their own networks, piggybacking on existing infrastructure. In some cases, these outfits are run directly by members of drug trafficking gangs including the Red Command or the Pure Third Command, one of its main rivals. Others are run by militias – a type of criminal outfit composed of retired and off-duty cops. In other cases, they are operated by businessmen who pay kickbacks to gangsters to clear out the competition.
Often the interlopers receive help from crooked employees of major providers who sell them expertise and pilfered gear, according to Rio state prosecutor Antonio Pessanha. He told Reuters he's investigating criminal activity in the telecom sector in and around Rio city, the state's capital.
In one recent case, an employee of Claro, the local unit of Mexico's America Movil SAB de CV (AMXL.MX), offered to sell company equipment to organized crime associates, according to a recorded phone call that Pessanha said his office obtained through a court-approved wiretap. He did not specify what criminal organization the people in the call were allegedly affiliated with, nor did he identify the Claro employee or the other participants. The investigation is ongoing, and Reuters was not provided access to the recording.
Claro declined to comment on the alleged incident.
NEW PLAYER IN ANT HILL
In Morro da Formiga, detective Ferrando said he began receiving anonymous tips from some of its roughly 5,000 residents in the first half of 2021 who said broadband services provided by major operators had stopped working.
One company dominates there now, Ferrando said, a firm named JPConnect Servicos de Telecomunicacoes. It was established in 2019, according to corporate registration documents filed with the Rio government and seen by Reuters.
Those records show that until late last year JPConnect was part-owned by an individual named Paulo Cesar Souza dos Santos Jr., whom authorities allege is a member of Comando Vermelho, or Red Command, Rio's largest organized criminal group. In 2011, Rio state prosecutors indicted dos Santos for drug and weapons trafficking, according to court records viewed by Reuters. He was later acquitted.
Dos Santos transferred his 50% stake in JPConnect in September 2021 to another investor, Alexandre Rodrigues de Almeida, according to the registration documents.
In January, police officers searched JPConnect's headquarters in Morro da Formiga, according to Ferrando. He said the cops found equipment belonging to TIM, Oi, Claro and Telefonica Brasil SA (VIVT3.SA), the local unit of Spain's Telefonica SA (TEF.MC). All of those companies declined to comment on Ferrando's allegations.
The JPConnect investigation hasn't been previously reported. Authorities haven't filed charges in the case. Reuters could not reach officials at JPConnect. The company's registered telephone number is not functioning.
Dos Santos and Almeida declined to comment through their lawyer. Their attorney, Eberthe Vieira de Souza Gomes, said JPConnect operates legally and had gained market share by offering a quality product. He said dos Santos has no connection to any criminal organization, pointing out that his client was acquitted of all charges related to his 2011 indictment. Reuters confirmed dos Santos' acquittal via Rio state court documents. Those documents did not specify the year of his acquittal.
TIM, Oi, Claro and Telefonica Brasil referred questions to Conexis, the telecom trade association. In an interview, Marcos Ferrari, the group's president, described a litany of woes facing Brazil's industry generally, including vandalism, theft, threats to employees and hijacking of service areas by players with suspected ties to the underworld.
Authorities must ""inhibit this type of criminal action,"" Ferrari said.
In greater Rio there are several other broadband operators under investigation for allegedly rough tactics and links to purported criminals, authorities said.
Among them is Net&Com, which made headlines in March 2021 when Rio police raided its downtown headquarters as part of a broader probe into an alleged drug ring. Police have publicly stated that they are investigating the firm for allegedly paying criminals associated with the Red Command to help them take over the telecoms market in poor neighborhoods throughout metropolitan Rio.
More than three dozen people, including purported members of the Red Command, last year were charged with drug and weapons trafficking and conspiracy, according to court documents filed by Rio prosecutors and viewed by Reuters. They are currently on trial and have maintained their innocence.
In documents laying out the government's case, authorities alleged the ring also profited by accepting kickbacks from Net&Com to chase telecom competitors out of neighborhoods where the company now operates. Net&Com and its executives have not been charged.
Pedro Santiago, a lawyer for Net&Com, said the company was an upstanding operator that had been the ""victim of a witch hunt."" Santiago said he had reviewed many hours of police wiretaps and that these showed no link between the firm and any criminal elements.
Police dispute that characterization in court documents seen by Reuters, citing as evidence allegedly stolen equipment and conversations among co-conspirators mentioning the alleged role of Net&Com.
Pessanha, the Rio state prosecutor, said the investigation continues.
""The new gold for the criminal underworld,"" he said, ""is the internet."""
Business,"Buyout firm TPG's fourth-quarter earnings jump 34% on strong asset sales
March 28 (Reuters) - TPG Inc (TPG.O) said on Monday its fourth-quarter after-tax distributable earnings rose 34% year-on-year, driven by strong asset sales across its portfolio of private equity, impact investment, growth equity, and real estate assets.
The performance of many private equity firms were boosted by a record-breaking year of deal-making in 2021, buoyed by buoyant public markets, the availability of cheap capital owing to low interest rates, and economic recovery from COVID-19 pandemic.
TPG's peers Blackstone Group Inc (BX.N), Carlyle Group Inc (CG.O), and KKR & Co Inc all reported record fourth quarter earnings as the firms sold off assets for top dollar last year. read more
The Forth Worth, Texas-based firm said its after-tax distributable earnings, which represents the cash used to pay dividends to shareholders, rose to $137 million from a $102 million a year earlier.
Its after-tax distributable earnings slightly exceeded the average Wall Street analyst estimate of $133 million for the fourth quarter, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.
TPG said it generated $7 billion from asset divestments across its portfolio in the quarter and spent $8 billion for new acquisitions, mostly in its private equity and real estate businesses.
Under generally accepted accounting principles, TPG reported a 46% drop in net income to $326 million, owing to a slowdown in revenue from capital allocation activities. TPG said it ended the quarter with $114 billion in assets under management and $28.4 billion in unspent capital.
Buyout firms face a more challenging year in 2022. The U.S. Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates to combat inflation and is expected to begin unwinding its bond-buying program, thus ending the era of easy financing for leveraged buyouts.
TPG said it still expects to capitalize on opportunities to invest in the current climate, particularly among growth-oriented companies that are shelving or postposting plans to go public amid a slowdown in stock market valuations.
""The IPO and SPAC markets are essentially shut down right now, particularly across the growth investing landscape, and we think it creates more opportunity for us because they are competitors to private equity as companies look for sources of capital,"" TPG Chief Executive Officer Jon Winkelried said in an interview.
""We're looking to be capital partners with really interesting strong companies but in the private markets.""
TPG made its stock market debut in January after raising $1.1 billion from an initial public offering that valued the firm at $9 billion."
Business,"EXCLUSIVE SpaceX ending production of flagship crew capsule
March 28 (Reuters) - SpaceX has ended production of new Crew Dragon astronaut capsules, a company executive told Reuters, as Elon Musk's space transportation company heaps resources on its next-generation spaceship program.
Capping the fleet at four Crew Dragons adds more urgency to the development of the astronaut capsule's eventual successor, Starship, SpaceX's moon and Mars rocket. Starship's debut launch has been delayed for months by engine development hurdles and regulatory reviews.
It also poses new challenges as the company learns how to maintain a fleet and quickly fix unexpected problems without holding up a busy schedule of astronaut missions.
""We are finishing our final (capsule), but we still are manufacturing components, because we'll be refurbishing,"" SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell told Reuters, confirming the plan to end Crew Dragon manufacturing.
She added that SpaceX would retain the capability to build more capsules if a need arises in the future, but contended that ""fleet management is key.""
Musk's business model is underpinned by reusable spacecraft, so it was inevitable the company would cease production at some point. But the timing was not known, nor was his strategy of using the existing fleet for its full backlog of missions.
Crew Dragon has flown five crews of government and private astronauts to space since 2020, when it flew its first pair of NASA astronauts and became the U.S. space agency's primary ride for getting humans to and from the International Space Station.
After each flight, the capsules undergo refurbishment at SpaceX facilities in Florida, which the company calls ""Dragonland.""
""There's lifetime cycle issues, where once you start using it the third, fourth, fifth time, you start finding different things,"" said retired NASA astronaut and former SpaceX executive Garrett Reisman, who now consults for the company on human spaceflight matters.
""SpaceX is really good about identifying these issues quickly and then acting quickly to fix them,"" Reisman added, pointing to an investigation in 2021 in which SpaceX discovered and fixed within months a toilet leak aboard a Crew Dragon capsule that had flown humans twice.
NASA has given SpaceX some $3.5 billion to help develop and subsequently use Crew Dragon for six flights to the space station. It added three more missions to fill in for delays with Boeing Co's (BA.N) Starliner capsule. read more
SpaceX has flown four crews of astronauts to the space station under its NASA contract at roughly $255 million per flight. The company carried out a fully private mission last year with four passengers, including a billionaire entrepreneur who funded the flight, for a three-day trip in Earth orbit.
At least four more private astronaut missions on Crew Dragon are planned with Houston-based space station builder and spaceflight manager Axiom Space, with the first so-called Ax-1 mission scheduled for April carrying four entrepreneurs to the space station to conduct scientific research.
Musk, SpaceX's founder and chief executive, has focused intensely in recent years on the company's hasty development of a re-usable Starship, the centerpiece of Musk's aim to eventually colonize Mars.
Like Crew Dragon, SpaceX's workhorse reusable rocket, the Falcon 9, and its more powerful variant Falcon Heavy are also refurbished after each flight, and not every component is able to fly to space more than once.
""The goal is to get more and more like aircraft operations, where you can take the vehicle after it lands, fill it back up with gas and oxygen, and go again very rapidly,"" Reisman said.
""Starship, if it achieves its design objectives, would be able to affordably replace everything that Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and Dragon can do.""

Business,"Apple to cut iPhone, AirPods output, Nikkei reports
March 28 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is planning to lower iPhone and AirPod production due to a demand slowdown caused by the Ukraine crisis and rising inflation, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday, citing sources briefed on the matter.
The company plans to produce 20% fewer iPhone SEs - or about 2 million to 3 million units - next quarter than originally planned, the report said. It added that Apple has also reduced 2022 orders for AirPods by more than 10 million units.
Apple, whose shares were down about 2% in premarket trading, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The news of weaker demand mirrors forecasts from analysts who have warned that COVID-19 lockdowns in Chinese cities and a surge in inflation due to the Ukraine conflict could hurt smartphone demand this year.
Apple, in particular, faces challenges from the lack of a design upgrade for the latest SE and a $30 increase in its price from the 2020 model, analysts have said.
Ming-Chi Kuo at TF International Securities on Monday slashed his shipment estimate for iPhone SE this year to between 15 million and 20 million units, from 25 million to 30 million units previously.
""It looks very similar to the iPhone SE (2020), a second refurbishment of the iPhone 8, and it is even less likely to arouse consumer demand,"" Taiwan-based Isaiah Research analyst Eddie Han said, cutting his forecast sales for the model by 5 million units.
Apple is expected to launch a brand new iPhone lineup later this year, but analysts say it was too early to forecast any impact on the upcoming range."
Business,"Analysis: U.S. Treasury yield curve divergence sends mixed recession signals
NEW YORK, March 28 (Reuters) - Two measures of the U.S. Treasury yield curve that are widely watched for recession warnings have veered in opposite directions, raising questions as to what degree central bank bond buying and other technical factors may be distorting the signals on the economy's path.
The spread between the yield on 3-month Treasury bills and 10-year notes this month has been widening , which can be an indicator of an economic expansion. On Friday, that curve reached its steepest in more than five years at 196 basis points.
The U.S. 2-year to 10-year curve , on the other hand, has flattened dramatically this year and is close to inverting, where the longer maturity would yield less than the shorter.
Typically, yield curves slope upward as investors demand a higher return on longer-term debt as it carries greater risk because of the higher probability of inflation or default.
A steepening curve typically signals expectations of stronger economic activity, higher inflation, and higher interest rates. A flattening curve suggests investors have lost confidence in the economy's growth outlook.
Inversions are considered a harbinger of eventual recession. But the signal right now is not clear.
""There is a technical issue here,"" said Ben Emons, managing director of global macro strategy at Medley Global Advisors. ""The 3-month T-bill yield is still lower...because it doesn't reflect rate hikes in the future. But it will rise, as the Fed hikes rates.""
U.S. two-year yields, on the other hand, are a really good indicator of where Federal Reserve policy is headed over the next two years, Emons added, and it's showing a much steeper path of rate hikes.
The 2s/10s spread was last at 20.10 basis points, having on Monday compressed to 11.4 basis points, its tightest since March 9, 2020, before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Fed raised short-term interest rates by 0.25 percentage point last week, the first hike since late 2018. U.S. rate futures on Friday priced in a roughly 75% chance of a half-percentage point tightening at its monetary policy meeting in May . For 2022, the futures market expects about 200 basis points of cumulative hikes by the Fed.
""If policy unfolds as the market expects, the 3-month/10-year curve will begin to flatten as more rate hikes become priced into the 3-month tenor,"" said Dan Belton, fixed income strategist, at BMO Capital.
""The divergence in 3-month and 2-yr Treasury rates suggests that the market is pricing in an increasingly hawkish Fed over the next two years.""
The last time the 3-month/10-year curve inverted was in February 2020. A month later, the Fed cut the benchmark overnight lending rate to near zero as the coronavirus pandemic wrought economic havoc around the world.
The 2s-10s inversions, on the other hand, preceded the last eight recessions, including 10 of the last 13, according to BoFA Securities in a research note. The last time this curve inverted was in 2019. The following year, the United States entered a recession, though one caused by the global pandemic.
But the 2-year/10-year yield curve also has its technical issues, and not everyone is convinced it's telling the true story.
""Something like 2s/10s, or 5s/30s, will definitely tell you that we're a lot flatter than we've ever been at the start of a hiking cycle,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, senior rates strategist at TD Securities.
""Part of that is just the sheer amount of Treasuries that the Fed bought during their COVID QE (quantitative easing) program."" Analysts said the Fed's QE the last two years has resulted in an undervalued U.S. 10-year yield and could explain away the disparity in the two yield curves.
Stan Shipley, fixed income strategist, at Evercore ISI in New York cited research which suggests the 10-year yield would be around 3.60% without that stimulus. When the Fed starts shrinking its balance sheet via quantitative tightening, Shipley said the 10-year yield will rise to fair value.
The U.S. 10-year yield was last at 2.475% after hitting a peak of 2.5% on Friday, the highest since May 2019.
""Without QE/balance sheet expansion, the 10-year and 2-year spread would be around 140 basis points, which is hardly threatening and consistent with the 10-year and 3-month spread,"" Shipley said.
The Evercore analyst thinks the 10-year yield should approach fair value in the first half of 2024, or about 120 basis points higher than the current level.
The U.S. 2-year yield, on the other hand, is fairly priced and Shipley expects the 2s-10s curve to widen.
What does it mean for the U.S. economy?
""Some of the 2-10 shape is down to the fact this is a far more aggressively priced Fed cycle than usual, the notion of how quickly the Fed will move is very front-loaded,"" said Timothy Graf, head of EMEA macro strategy, at State Street.
""I suspect we will get a growth slowdown but will it lead to recession? It may be next year's story. Households will want to see the fuel prices coming down but generally household balance sheets are in pretty good shape."""
Business,"Nearly 60% of Toshiba shareholders rejected spin-off plan
TOKYO, March 28 (Reuters) - Nearly 60% of Toshiba Corp (6502.T) shareholders voted last week against a plan to spin off its devices business, a breakdown of the vote showed.
A separate call from activist shareholder 3D Investment Partners for a private equity buyout was rejected by just short of 55% of shareholders who voted. Both proposals needed 50% of the vote to pass at last Thursday's extraordinary meeting.
With the two competing proposals both voted down, the Japanese conglomerate is left to seek alternatives, potentially focusing on new CEO Taro Shimada's plan to boost subscription revenue by tying software to hardware. 
There was widespread opposition to the management-backed plan to spin off the devices business, including from Toshiba's three biggest shareholders and proxy shareholder advisory firms.
The proposal from 3D, Toshiba's second-biggest shareholder with a stake of more than 7%, had the backing of other activist shareholders but proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) had advised against it."

March 28 (Reuters) - Polish postal locker operator InPost (INPST.AS) said on Monday that it was not in talks over selling the company, after its stock jumped by almost third following a report from Bloomberg which said several firms were interested in a deal.
""Although parties may from time to time approach InPost or its majority shareholder, InPost is currently not in discussions with such market parties nor is it aware of such discussions ongoing,"" it said in a statement.

Business,"Chinese pork giant WH Group's 2021 profit lifted by higher US, European sales
BEIJING, March 28 (Reuters) - Chinese pork processing giant WH Group Ltd (0288.HK) on Monday reported a 7.2% rise in annual profit to $1.043 billion driven by higher sales in the United States and Europe.
Revenue at the group, which owns U.S.-based Smithfield Foods, the world's largest pork processor, grew 6.7% in 2021 to $27.29 billion, according to a company filing.
Profit before biological fair value adjustments rose after low hog prices reduced product costs in China while higher sales and a reduction in COVID-19 related expenses in the U.S. outweighed an increase in raw material costs, the company said.
WH Group reported a 1.3% rise in the sales of packaged meats, its core business, to 3.32 million tonnes in 2021.
Sales volume in China, however, dropped by 1.6% in a consumer market lacking growth momentum.
Hog prices in China plunged last year as farmers rebuilt herds after an epidemic of African swine fever but COVID-19 outbreaks dampened demand.
WH Group told reporters that Chinese hog prices would remain low in the first half of 2022 before rising in the second half. Most analysts expect prices to remain low this year.
Rising commodity prices and production costs would remain a challenge it said, with its import and export business also affected by the pandemic - one executive noted longer shipment cycles and customs processes and higher costs.
WH Group's China business Shuanghui Development (000895.SZ) reported a 22.2% fall in net profit to 4.87 billion yuan ($764.69 million) on lower hog and meat prices, and said profit from frozen products and pork imports had dropped considerably.
Shuanghui was recently forced to apologise after a local media investigation uncovered food safety issues at one of its plants.
WH Group last year removed executive director Wan Hongjian, chairman Wan Long's son, citing untrue allegations he made against the company.

Business,"Tesla seeks investor approval for stock split
March 28 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) will seek investor approval to increase its number of shares to enable a stock split in the form of a dividend, the electric-car maker said on Monday, sending its shares up 5% before the bell.
The proposal has been approved by its board and the shareholders will vote on it at the annual meeting. The stock split, if approved, would be the latest after a five-for-one split in August 2020 that made Tesla shares cheaper for its employees and investors.
Following a pandemic-induced rally in the technology shares, Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O) too have in the recent past split their shares to make them more affordable.
Telsa, which debuted at $17 per share in 2010, is currently trading above $1,000. Since the stock split in 2020, they have surged 128%, boosting the market capitalization to above $1 trillion and making the company the biggest U.S. automaker by that measure.
Tesla's electric cars are among the most sold and it has delivered nearly a million cars annually, while ramping up production by setting up new factories in the United States and Europe.
However, the company is also beginning to face competition as legacy automakers such as Ford (F.N) and startups including Rivian (RIVN.O) enter the market, giving consumers a number of new options.
Tesla said the stock dividend will be contingent on final approval."
Business,"Former aircraft designer Shimada may find silver lining in Toshiba gloom
TOKYO, March 28 (Reuters) - The crisis at Toshiba Corp (6502.T) may have a silver lining for new boss Taro Shimada, allowing him to keep - at least for now - businesses pivotal to his digital strategy that predecessors had planned to sell.
Investors last week voted down management's plan to spin off Toshiba's devices unit, as well as a rival shareholder proposal to solicit buyout offers. That left the troubled 146-year-old conglomerate without a clear immediate direction.
But it could give Shimada, a former aircraft designer and Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) executive, leeway for his plan to boost subscription revenue by tying software to hardware.
It also allows him to hang onto equipment maker Toshiba Tec Corp (6588.T), which was considered ""non core"" in the now-rejected spin-off. Shimada has praised some businesses at Toshiba Tec for marrying digital to hardware and sources say he didn't want to sell it.
It's unclear if Shimada will be able to appease the hedge funds that own around 30% of Toshiba and are impatient for a private equity buyout. But as Thursday's vote shows, they don't have enough support to completely call the shots. read more
The outcome of the vote gives Shimada ""carte blanche"" to show he can deliver, said veteran Japan analyst Jesper Koll of Monex Group.
""For the first time in over a decade, you've got a CEO at Toshiba who actually is a technologist, who understands technology, who has hands-on experience,"" he said.
Big manufacturers are increasingly pushing into higher-margin digital services. Shimada's former employer, Siemens, wants to expand its customer base through digital services that improve factories, buildings and train systems.
Shimada says he's the first Toshiba head to understand digital. He was brought in as chief strategy officer for digital in 2018 by then CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani, also a company outsider, who wooed him over ramen noodles in Tokyo's Shimbashi district.
Kurumatani stepped down last year amid a governance scandal and shareholder opposition. Toshiba later said the former boss violated ethical standards. Shimada became the third CEO in about a year when he took over this month from Satoshi Tsunakawa, who remains board chairman. read more
CONSTANT TURMOIL
Toshiba has been in turmoil since a 2015 accounting scandal and the later bankruptcy of U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse. Overseas investors injected $5.4 billion and saved it from delisting, but that brought on hedge funds as shareholders.
Four years of dealing with foreign activist hedge funds - and their varied demands for buybacks, board reshuffles and a resumption of buyout talks - has left management distracted, sources say.
The firm's stock market value has fallen to around $18 billion, half of an early 2000s peak.
Shimada says Toshiba can no longer sell just hardware and needs to add digital services to improve both products and margins.
He repeated that message ""over and over"" at internal meetings when he first joined, he told Reuters in an interview two years ago.
""I'm trying to show what digital transformation means,"" he said in the interview.
Meanwhile, rival Hitachi Ltd (6501.T) has been transforming itself for a decade already, selling off low-growth businesses and investing in its digital and services platform. Last year it bought U.S. software firm GlobalLogic for $9.6 billion including debt.
Toshiba's operating profit margin was 3.42% in the last financial year, less than half of Hitachi's 9.38%, according to Refinitiv.
SCEPTICAL
Investors remain sceptical of the company's ability to mount a turnaround on its own.
While Toshiba is an ""incredible company with incredible technology inside"" it has become ""less than the sum of its parts,"" said Brian Heywood, CEO of Taiyo Pacific Partners, which doesn't own Toshiba shares.
The company ""hasn't defined how its parts go together,"" Heywood said.
Shimada cites Toshiba Tec's ""Smart Receipt"" app, which works with its point-of-sales systems, as one digitalisation example.
The app replaces paper receipts with electronic ones and sends coupons to users' phones. Retailers get data for advertising and promotions.
Shimada declined to comment this month when asked about the classification, since changed, of Toshiba Tec as ""non core"". He did say the business was ""extremely good"". The company commands about half of the domestic market for point-of-sales systems.
He also sees potential for a cybersecurity subscription service based on quantum computing that protects users from advanced cyberattacks.
Shimada hasn't publicly stated his stance on a potential private equity buyout that hedge fund shareholders have been calling for.
If that happens, he could still pursue his strategy - provided existing management were allowed to stay on."
Business,"Huawei 'more united' in face of U.S. pressure, says repatriated CFO
SHANGHAI, March 28 (Reuters) - U.S. pressure on Huawei Technologies (HWT.UL) has served to strengthen the resolve of the Chinese telecoms giant, finance chief Meng Wanzhou said on Monday after its first set of results since her return from nearly three years' detention in Canada.
The daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei played a central role in the company's tussle with the United States, having been detained in Canada in 2018 over alleged attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran in breach of U.S. sanctions.
The United States then imposed a series of trade restrictions on the company throughout 2019 and 2020, citing national security concerns. This impeded Huawei's ability to design its own chips and to source components from outside vendors, crippling its smartphone businesses.
Meng was allowed to return to China in September after agreement with U.S. prosecutors to end a bank fraud case.
""Over the past few years our teams have undertaken a lot of pressure, and along this process we have become more united and our strategy has become clearer,"" she told reporters in her first public appearance at a company event, adding that Huawei had become more capable of dealing with uncertainty.
Asked what she had been doing since she returned to work six months ago, Meng said the world had changed so much.
""I've been learning and trying to catch up,"" she said.
STEEP REVENUE DROP
Washington's sanctions have continued to weigh heavily on Huawei's business.
Full-year revenue tumbled 29% last year to 636.8 billion yuan ($100 billion). Net profit jumped by a record 76% to 113.7 billion yuan, but that was mainly thanks to the sale of its Honor handset division and server businesses under U.S. pressure.
Meng attributed the revenue drop to the impact of U.S sanctions on the smartphone business, adding that the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain issues and slowing demand for 5G base stations in China were also contributing factors.
Guo Ping, Huawei's current rotating chairman, said the company hopes to find a solution to sustain its smartphone division and will ramp up investment in research seeking microchip ""breakthroughs"" after losing access to certain advanced technologies because of U.S. sanctions.
Though Guo did not directly answer repeated questions on whether Huawei planned to build its own chip manufacturing facility, he highlighted artificial intelligence (AI), Wifi6 connectivity, green energy, automotive and cloud computing as key areas for R&D and new business opportunities.
Asked if Huawei would be affected by U.S. sanctions against Russia, Guo said the company is evaluating related policies, adding that it has no plans to take its mobile operating system Harmony OS overseas.
Many observers have questioned whether Chinese companies such as Huawei can fill the void left by overseas companies that have exited Russia in protest over the conflict in Ukraine.

Business,"Carlsberg joins rival Heineken in quitting Russia, faces big hit
COPENHAGEN, March 28 (Reuters) - Carlsberg (CARLb.CO) will exit the Russian market and take a ""substantial"" non-cash impairment charge, the Danish brewer said on Monday, the latest Western company to exit amid mounting pressure on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.
Dutch brewer Heineken (HEIN.AS) also announced on Monday it had decided to exit its Russian business at a cost of 400 million euros ($438 million). read more
""We have taken the difficult and immediate decision to seek a full disposal of our business in Russia, which we believe is the right thing to do in the current environment,"" Carlsberg said. ""Upon completion we will have no presence in Russia.""
Carlsberg, the Western brewer most exposed to the Russian market, launched a strategic review of its Russian business this month but had kept its eight breweries in the country operating.
The decision to exit Russia would result in a ""substantial non-cash impairment charge"" this year, it said without providing further details.
Carlsberg had non-current assets in Russia worth 19.2 billion Danish crowns by the end of 2021, which amounts to around 15% of total assets or 44% of its total equity, its annual report showed."
Business,"Oil slides on concerns of weaker Chinese demand
LONDON (Reuters) -Oil prices tumbled more than $5 on Monday as fears over weaker fuel demand in China grew after financial hub Shanghai lockdown efforts to curb a surge in COVID-19 infections.
Brent crude futures slid as low as $115.32 a barrel and were trading down $4.53, or 3.7%, at $116.12 at 0943 GMT.
U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures hit a low of $108.28 a barrel, and were down $4.55, or 3.9%, at $109.35.
Both benchmark contracts rose 1.4% on Friday, notching their first weekly gains in three weeks, with Brent surging 11.8% and WTI climbing 8.8%.
Shanghai has entered a two-stage lockdown of 26 million people on Monday in an attempt to curb the further spread of the coronavirus.
“This is also prompting growing concerns that China’s strict zero-Covid policy will lead to repeated lockdowns in key business centres,” said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch in a note.
Oil demand in China, the largest crude importer globally, is expected to be 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) softer in April compared with “normal” levels as a result, said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB bank.
Hopes for reconciliation from peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, which could start in Turkey on Tuesday according to the Kremlin, also weighed on prices.
And the bullish reaction to a missile attack by Yemen’s Houthis on a Saudi oil distribution facility had ran its course on Friday, said Kazuhiko Saito, chief analyst at Fujitomi Securities.
But he expected the oil market to turn bullish when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, meet on Thursday to discuss a planned 432,000 bpd increase in production quotas. The group, which has so far resisted calls to accelerate production rises to ease tight crude supply, was “less likely to raise oil output at a faster pace than in recent months,” Saito said.
And supply deficits are looming, as April spot volumes of Russian crude will struggle to find buyers, analysts said. Russia’s crude flows have been little affected in March as most volumes were contracted pre-invasion.
“Expectations are that 2.5 m bl/d of Russian crude and products will be lost in April,” Schieldrop said, adding that the diesel shortages will increase demand for Brent crude and light sweet crudes.
OECD stockpiles are at their lowest since 2014.
To help ease tight supply, the United States is considering another release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), but this could be limited given already low inventories.
U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a 19th consecutive month but at the slowest pace since 2020 even though the government urged producers to boost output."

March 28 (Reuters) - HP Inc (HPQ.N) said on Monday it would buy audio and video devices maker Poly (POLY.N) for $1.7 billion in cash as it looks to capitalise on the hybrid work led boom in demand for electronic products.
Shares in HP, which expects the deal will position it for long-term growth, fell 1.4% in premarket trade.
The company has offered $40 for each share of Poly, formerly known as Plantronics, which represents a premium of about 53% to the stock's last closing price. Including debt, the deal is valued at $3.3 billion.
""The rise of the hybrid office creates a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine the way work gets done,"" HP Chief Executive Officer Enrique Lores said.

""All G7 ministers have agreed that this is a unilateral and clear breach of existing contracts,"" Habeck, who is German economy and climate protection minister, told reporters after a virtual conference with G7 energy ministers.

Business,"TIM boosted as CVC approach for enterprise service unit confirmed
MILAN, March 28 (Reuters) - Telecom Italia (TIM) (TLIT.MI) shares rose on Monday as Italy's biggest telecoms company confirmed CVC's interest in taking a stake in its enterprise service arm, while it is also weighing a takeover approach for the group by KKR (KKR.N).
The CVC move comes as newly-appointed TIM Chief Executive Pietro Labriola presses ahead with a plan to split TIM's service business from its network operations as part of a broader strategy to revamp the former phone monopoly.
TIM said CVC proposed setting up an entity including connectivity operations for big corporate clients as well cloud, cybersecurity and IoT services, in which the European private equity firm would take a minority stake, confirming what sources told Reuters on Saturday. read more .
TIM added in statement that its talks with U.S. fund KKR to assess the ""attractiveness, actuality and deliverability"" of its 10.8 billion euro ($11.9 billion) approach for the group as a whole were ongoing.
Shares in TIM were up 3% on Monday at 0.34 euro after the stock hit a record low of 0.22 earlier this month. The price remains well below the 0.505 euro price at which the KKR approach was pitched late last year.
BOARD MEETING
The TIM board will have a first look at the CVC proposal at a meeting scheduled for Tuesday and also assess the state of play with the KKR approach.
KKR submitted its non-binding takeover proposal for TIM in November, having already invested 1.8 billion euros for a 37.5% stake in the group's last-mile fixed-line network last year.
TIM left the New York-based fund waiting for nearly four months without an answer before agreeing earlier in March to engage in talks, while pressing ahead with its standalone reorganisation to unlock the group ""untapped value"".
TIM, which is grappling with fierce competition in its domestic market, was hit by multiple downgrades by rating agencies this month after it unveiled a record annual loss and a weak outlook.
Last week KKR said it remained interested in taking over TIM but also wants to discuss the phone group's own plans to combine its fixed line assets with those of state-backed rival Open Fiber. read more
While TIM's top shareholder Vivendi (VIV.PA) billed KKR's proposal as too low, state lender CDP is advocating a tie-up of TIM's fixed network assets with those of Open Fiber to avoid a costly duplication of investment to upgrade the national network.
CDP, which owns a 10% holding in TIM, controls a 60% stake in the smaller rival fiber optic firm.
Sources have also said a compromise with KKR could be possible, whereby TIM seeks to deepen existing cooperation with the U.S. fund, involving it in its plans to split off its fixed network infrastructure and merge it with that of Open Fiber. ($1 = 0.9106 euros)"
Business,"Massive food market in Mexico City poised to harness sunshine for power
MEXICO CITY, March 28 (Reuters) - A sprawling fruit and vegetable market in Mexico's capital wants to spark a greener future as the world's biggest urban solar farm, with thousands of photovoltaic panels set to be installed this year on the seemingly endless roofs of its buildings.
The 400 million peso ($19.9 million) roof-top solar project will cover a chaotic wholesale market that serves half a million customers daily, extending over a land equivalent to about 400 football fields.
Once online later this year, the Central de Abasto market's roofs will power some 18 megawatts of generating capacity, according to Fadlala Akabani, the capital's economic development minister, or enough to supply around 14,000 homes.
The project marks a rare green initiative during the government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has mostly sought to prioritize fossil fuel production and power generation via two state-run energy giants - national oil company Pemex and electricity utility CFE.
The CFE is, however, designing the market solar installation and will later operate it.
During his first three years in office, Lopez Obrador has quarreled with private firms that have invested heavily in renewable power in Mexico, even pushing a reform that would cancel many existing private power projects.
""The development of large-scale (solar) projects has been on hold for over a year,"" said Javier Romero of solar energy association ANES, pointing to heightened political risk and legal limbo seen undermining would-be private generators.
""Who is going to invest without guarantees?""
Solar only contributed about 5% of Mexican power generation last year, according to industry data.
But Mexican solar generation in percentage terms is greater than in the United States, where it contributed almost 3% last year, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed.
While the EIA forecasts that U.S. solar will grow to a fifth of the country's electricity by 2050, Mexico's state-run CFE declined to provide its own estimate.
""It's not about percentages, but instead to plan out our energy transition,"" CFE spokesman Luis Bravo told Reuters.
'WOEFULLY INADEQUATE'
Mexico's past governments have pledged to reach 35% clean energy by 2024, up from 29% currently anchored largely by the CFE's hydroelectric plants and private wind farms. But hitting that target is seen by sector experts as all but impossible given current trends.
Mexico City's wholesale market constitutes one bright spot.
The market is home to around 10,000 booths that mostly sell fruits, vegetables and meat, one of them operated by Arturo Mesa, whose stall was covered by mountains of apples and lettuce on a recent visit.
Mesa hopes new solar panels can cut his power bill.
""I pay 5,000 pesos ($249) every month. That's too much,"" he said.
Around 36,000 panels are set to blanket building roofs and ultimately generate much more power than the market consumes, with the excess electricity likely made available to other users, said Jose Alberto Valdes, a top energy official with the city's government.
Valdes added that officials aim to equip additional market rooftops with solar panels, but provided no further details.
CFE's Bravo said Lopez Obrador also wants to boost solar power, and pointed to the company's industrial-scale $1.6 billion photovoltaic project planned for northern Mexico's Sonora state.
The facility is expected to cover 2,000 hectares of sunbaked desert, and feature a 1,000-megawwat annual generating capacity.
But it's not expected to come online until 2028.
The solar association's Romero argues that the electricity generation projects in Sonora and Mexico City are woefully inadequate given Mexico's potential.
""It's peanuts,"" he said. ""These are not figures to brag about.""

Business,"Thai economy may grow 3.0%-3.5% this year, interest rate to stay low - Finance Minister
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand’s economy could grow 3.0%-3.5% this year, less than an earlier forecast due to soaring oil prices driven by the Russia-Ukraine war, and the key interest rate should remain low to underpin recovery, the finance minister said on Monday.
Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy will, however, be supported by strong exports, which could grow 5%-6% this year, and by improved tourism as the government plans to ease more pandemic-related curbs, Arkhom Termpittayapaisith told Reuters in an interview.
“Growth of 3.0%-3.5% should be achievable this year, and 2023 should be better”, as several government infrastructure projects will be completed, he said.
In February, the state planning agency predicted the economy would grow 3.5%-4.5% this year, after expanding just 1.6% last year, among the slowest rates in the region.
The economy is also expected to grow in the first quarter both on the year and on the quarter, Arkhom said.
Monetary policy should continue to support the recovery as the government tries to manage higher inflation, which is expected to be 3%-4% on average this year, slightly above the central bank’s 1%-3% target range, he said.
“On the monetary side, don’t raise rates too soon,” he said, referring to the central bank.
The central bank has left its key interest rate at a record low of 0.50% since May 2020 to maintain support for the economy. It is expected to keep policy unchanged when it meets on Wednesday.
The current level of the baht is “appropriate” and supports exports, Arkhom said.
“The baht may swing, but at 33 baht per dollar, everyone should be happy”.
The government has sufficient funds to help the economy and there was no need for further borrowing yet, he said."
Business,"Israeli startup to test brain-activity gear on space mission to ISS
TEL AVIV, March 28 (Reuters) - Israel's Brain.Space, a four-year-old startup that studies data on brain activity, is set to put its gear to test on astronauts in space next week during a SpaceX shuttle flight to the International Space Station (ISS).
Three astronauts on the planned private space-flight firm Axiom Space's mission to the ISS will use a special electroencephalogram (EEG)-enabled helmet made by Brain.Space, the company said on Monday.
The 10-day mission, the first-ever private trip to the space station,will set off on April 3 with four astronauts.
""We actually know that the microgravity environment impacts the physiological indicators in the body. So, it will probably impact the brain and we would like to monitor that,"" Brain.Space Chief Executive Yair Levy told Reuters.
Data has continuously been collected on heart rate, skin resistance, muscle mass and others in space but not yet on brain activity, he said.
Brain.Space joins 30 experiments that will take part in the so-called Rakia Mission to the ISS.
Three of the four astronauts -- including Israeli Eytan Stibbe -- will wear the helmet, which has 460 airbrushes that connect to the scalp, and perform a number of tasks for 20 minutes a day, during which data will be uploaded to a laptop on the space station. The tasks include a ""visual oddball"" one that the company says has been effective in detecting abnormal brain dynamics.
Similar studies using these tasks have been completed on Earth and after the mission, Brain.Space will compare the EEG data to see the differences in brain activity between Earth and space.
It noted that such experiments are needed since long-term space exploration and ""off-world living are within grasp.""
Brain.Space, which also said it raised $8.5 million in a seed funding round, bills itself as a brain infrastructure company and is working with the cognitive and brain sciences department at Israel's Ben Gurion University to transform terabytes of data into usable insights.
Levy said he hoped the space mission would be a springboard for other institutions, researchers and software developers to use its brain data platform.
""Space is an accelerator. The idea is to revolutionise and make possible brain activity apps, products and services that's as easy as pulling data from an Apple Watch,"" Levy said, pointing to measuring ADHD as an example."

BRUSSELS, March 28 (Reuters) - Companies affected by sanctions imposed on Russia and soaring energy costs are unlikely to get trillions of euros in state aid that businesses hit by the COVID-19 pandemic received because the impact is smaller, EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said on Monday.
Vestager last week loosened state aid rules allowing firms to get up to 400,000 euros ($438,520) in state support and compensation up to 30% of energy costs after thousands of companies from airlines to automakers reported disruptions to their supply chains. read more
She told Reuters in an interview there was a big difference between the current situation caused by sanctions imposed on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine and the pandemic when more businesses were hit by national lockdowns, and that would limit the amount of aid handed out this time.
""It's really early days, but I wouldn't think so,"" Vestager said, when asked whether European Union governments would end up again pumping trillions of euros into sanctions-hit companies.
""Because you don't have sort of this blanket state intervention in how the market works, you know, having the states coming in, the governments coming in and basically just telling everyone to hibernate,"" she said.
Vestager has so far approved more than 3 trillion euros ($3.29 trillion) in aid for pandemic-hit companies under relaxed rules adopted two years ago.
She reiterated that those rules will not be extended.
""The main part of the pandemic temporary framework is (for) that to end by mid year,"" she said.

Business,"In Istanbul and Dubai, Russians pile into property to shelter from sanctions
ISTANBUL/DUBAI, March 28 (Reuters) - Wealthy Russians are pouring money into real estate in Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, seeking a financial haven in the wake of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and Western sanctions, according to many property companies.
""We sell seven to eight units to Russians every day,"" said Gul Gul, co-founder of the Golden Sign real estate company in Istanbul. ""They buy in cash, they open bank accounts in Turkey or they bring gold.""
In Dubai, Thiago Caldas, CEO of the Modern Living property firm, has hired three Russian-speaking agents to meet Russian interest, which he says has leapt tenfold.
Sanctions imposed since the Feb. 24 invasion include Russia's exclusion from the SWIFT banking system, and the targeting of individual such as oligarchs deemed to be close to President Vladimir Putin.
While Turkey and the UAE have criticised the Russian offensive, Ankara opposes non-U.N. sanctions on Russia and both countries have relatively good ties with Moscow and still operate direct flights, potentially offering routes out for Russians and their cash.
""They are wealthy Russians but not oligarchs,"" said Gul of Golden Sign, one of a dozen real estate companies interviewed by Reuters. ""They are finding ways to bring their money to Turkey.""
""There are customers buying three to five flats,"" Gul added.
Russians have been big buyers of Turkish property for years, behind Iranians and Iraqis, yet the real estate players said there had been a spike in demand in recent weeks.
Though it's still early days, industry figures bolster their accounts; In February, as troops massed on Ukraine's border before advancing, Russians bought 509 houses in Turkey, nearly double the number they snapped up last year, according to the country's statistics office.
That data was still before Western sanctions took hold, and real estate agents said they expected the numbers to grow further, driving up demand already primed by the world's emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ibrahim Babacan, whose company in Istanbul builds and sells real estate mainly for foreign buyers in Turkey, said in the past many Russians had wanted to live in resorts such as the Mediterranean Antalya region. Now they were buying apartments in Istanbul to invest their money.
Reuters contacted some Russian homebuyers but they declined to give interviews due to the sensitivity of the situation.
THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS
Both Turkey and the United Arab Emirates offer residency incentives for property buyers. In Turkey foreigners who pay $250,000 for a property and keep it for three years can get a Turkish passport. For a slightly smaller sum Dubai, a major Middle East business hub, offers a three-year residency visa.
Apartments worth 750,000 dirhams ($205,000) - the threshold for visa entitlement - have seen the bulk of the demand but more expensive property on artificial islands such as Dubai's glitzy Palm Jumeirah have been bought for up to 6 million dirhams, according to the real estate professionals.
""Investors are looking for both capital protection and the opportunity to receive a residential visa in the UAE for temporary relocation,"" said Elena Milishenkova of real estate brokerage Tranio, based in Moscow and Berlin, which has a focus on Russian clients buying property overseas.
Her company received almost three times more requests for apartments in Dubai in the first three months of 2022 compared to the same period last year, she said.
Some companies say demand is even higher.
""Right at the beginning of the invasion of Ukraine, we launched a campaign in the region and the number of people who contacted us was ... at least 10 times higher than usual,"" said Caldas of Dubai's Modern Living.
The CEO, who hired the Russian-speaking agents last week, said the really wealthy buyers appeared to have been making their preparations and shifted funds out of Russia even before the war broke out a month ago.
CASH AND CRYPTOCURRENCY
For Russians who have bank accounts in Dubai, the process is relatively simple, said Elena Timchenko of broker Royal Home Real Estate, which is based in the emirate.
Others have turned to friends or contacts for help, but for some, the challenge of getting the money together for a purchase has so far been too much, she added.
""The wish to buy in Dubai is one thing, the ability to do so is another,"" she said, referring to the difficulties of bringing funds to the Gulf state.
Some newly arrived Russians in Turkey have struggled to make deposits and transfers at banks that are wary of contravening sanctions. Extra layers of compliance and exclusion from Visa and Mastercard add to the difficulty. read more
The UAE issued guidelines to banks last year to tighten procedures identifying suspicious transactions in an attempt to stem illicit financial flows. That did not stop the country, like Turkey, being added to a list of countries monitored by the FATF global financial crime watchdog. read more
A senior executive at an Emirati bank said the bank was making the same checks on customers as before, and had received no new guidance from the central bank.
In Istanbul, meanwhile, real estate builder and seller Babacan said that so far those Russian customers he dealt with were paying via banks without problems.
Caldas and Alex Cihanoglu, a realtor also based in Turkey's largest city, said some Russians were using cash converted from cryptocurrency, now that sanctions had made financial transfers more complex.
""I would say most of the transactions that we're seeing are in crypto,"" Caldas added. ""Crypto, especially for this market now, in the difficulties they're facing, is the channel that is being used.""

According to the document, Credit Suisse has been striving to reduce its business contacts with Russia, helping clients limit their own exposure to the country and transferring employees to other locations.
It confirmed roughly 4% of assets under management in its wealth management unit belonged to Russian clients. "
Business,"UK's Ted Baker rebuffs U.S. private equity firm's takeover proposals
(Reuters) -Britain’s Ted Baker said on Monday it had rejected two unsolicited takeover proposals from private-equity firm Sycamore Partners Management as they significantly undervalued the fashion retailer.
The company said the back-to-back proposals from New York-based Sycamore failed to “compensate shareholders for the significant upside that can be delivered by Ted Baker as a listed company”.
Takeover interest in British companies is at its highest in years as the pandemic and uncertainties linked to Britain’s exit from the European Union have led to a steep drop in valuations.
Sycamore had raised its proposal for Ted Baker to 137.5 pence per share on March 22, valuing the retailer at 253.8 million pounds ($333.65 million), after its initial proposal of 130 pence per share was turned down by the British group.
The revised proposal represents a premium of nearly 40% over Ted Baker’s closing price on March 17, when the Sycamore approach was first reported.
Sycamore, which has until April 15 to make a firm offer for the London-listed company, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Ted Baker’s shares were down 3.3% at 122 pence as of 0930 GMT after the upmarket retailer disclosed the proposals.
“It’s unsurprising that management’s not keen to give up the reins after a few difficult years,” said Laura Hoy, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.
“We’re finally starting to see some green shoots from the group’s turnaround efforts now that formal occasions are back on the social calendar.”
Ted Baker is in the middle of a three-year turnaround plan under boss Rachel Osborne as it aims to boost savings and strengthen its online presence.
The group had faced setbacks, including profit warnings, management changes and an accounting scandal, since founder Ray Kelvin stepped down in 2019 amid misconduct allegations, which he denies.
The coronavirus crisis compounded difficulties, as lockdowns and restrictions hammered retail operations and forced the company to cut hundreds of jobs.
The group’s shares, which traded as high as 30 pounds in 2015, have since crashed to trade at 1.26 pounds as of Friday’s close.

Business,"Heineken to exit Russia at cost of around 400 million euros
AMSTERDAM/BRUSSELS March 28 (Reuters) - Dutch brewing giant Heineken (HEIN.AS) said on Monday it has decided to exit its business in Russia at an expected cost of 400 million euros ($438 million), after previously saying it would only halt new investment and exports to the country.
The company joins a raft of Western brands shuttering businesses in Russia following its invasion of Ukraine, with Heineken's move likely to dial up pressure on Danish rival Carlsberg (CARLb.CO), the owner of Russia's biggest brewer, Baltika.
""We have concluded that Heineken's ownership of the business in Russia is no longer sustainable nor viable in the current environment,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it would not profit from any transfer of ownership.
Heineken is the third largest brewer in Russia, where it owns local brands Bochkarev, Okhota and Tri Medvedya. It said it aimed for an ""orderly transfer"" and would continue the business with reduced operations during a transition period to minimise the risk of nationalisation.
The company said it would guarantee the salaries of its 1,800 Russian employees to the end of this year and expected an impairment charge and other non-cash exceptional charges of around 400 million euros.
Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged international companies to leave the Russian market after Moscow launched what it termed its ""special military operation"" against its neighbour. read more
Although Heineken is a major player on the Russian market, sales there account for just 2% of the company's total.
Shares were up 0.8% at 88.16 euros by 0835 GMT in Amsterdam.
Carlsberg, with a 27.3% local market share, is still selling beer under the Baltika brand but said earlier this month it had begun a strategic review of its business in the country and was suspending Russian brewing of its namesake brand of beer.
""Heineken's decision probably does not make the situation easier for Carlsberg,"" said Nordnet analyst Per Hansen in a research note.
Russia's second largest brewer is a joint venture owned by Turkey's Anadolu Efes (AEFES.IS) and Belgium's InBev (ABI.BR).
InBev said earlier in March it would stop selling Bud beer in Russia and forego profits from the joint venture, which has 11 breweries and 3,500 employees in the country.

LONDON, March 28 (Reuters) - British bank Barclays (BARC.L) disclosed on Monday an estimated 450 million pound ($592 million) loss on mishandled structured product sales and said this meant it would now delay a share buyback.
The lender said it offered and sold nearly twice as many affected securities over a period of about a year as it was registered to sell in the United States, overshooting its $20.8 billion limit by $15.2 billion.
The securities would now have to be bought back at their original purchase price, the bank said.
The products were two exchange-traded notes linked to crude oil and market volatility , a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. The bank suspended sales and issuance of the notes this month. read more
The bank said its ""best estimate at this time"" was that the loss would amount to 450 million pounds, cutting its core capital ratio down to the middle of its 13-14% target range. The loss estimate did not include tax.
Barclays said it would delay a planned 1 billion pound share buyback until the second quarter, adding that it had commissioned an independent review of the matter.
Regulators were also conducting inquiries and requesting information, the bank said.
Shares in the bank were down 3% in early trading.
Barclays' wider investment bank had previously proved a stellar performer for the group over recent years, helping it post a record annual profit for 2021. read more
Analysts at Shore Capital said in a note that the bank appeared to be ""tripping over its shoelaces"".

Business,"BOJ offers four days unlimited bond-buying to defend yield cap
TOKYO (Reuters) -Struggling to swim against the tide taking interest rates higher globally, the Bank of Japan staunchly defended its 0.25% yield cap on Monday by offering to buy an unlimited amount of government bonds for the first four days of this week.
The BOJ’s defence of its ultra-loose policy pushed the yen to a six-year low of 124 to the dollar on Monday, adding to the problems Japan’s economy is facing from already surging costs for fuel and raw material imports.
Under pressure from a steady rise in yields, the BOJ launched its defence by making two offers in a single day to purchase 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) in unlimited amounts at 0.25%.
The central bank then said it would make the same unlimited offer for the next three days, to make sure investors received the message loud and clear, but some economists believed the central bank’s grip on yield curve control was at risk of slipping.
“The power of the BOJ’s unlimited bond-buy offer is clearly waning,” said Takahide Kiuchi, a former central bank board member who is now an economist at Nomura Research Institute.
“Markets may more forcefully test the BOJ’s resolve to defend the 0.25% ceiling, which may prompt the bank to modify its approach and allow the 10-year yield to rise more.”
The BOJ’s first offer for unlimited bond buying in the morning failed to prevent the 10-year JGB yield from hitting a six-year high of 0.250% on Monday - the level the bank has set as an implicit cap around its yield target.
The central bank made a second offer in the afternoon to buy unlimited amounts of JGBs with maturities of more than five years and up to 10 years.
While the first offer drew no bids, the BOJ accepted bids to buy 64.5 billion yen ($524 million) in JGBs in the second offer.
The two offers, which were the first since Feb. 10, underscored the BOJ’s resolve to keep rates ultra-low in contrast to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive rate hike plans.
The BOJ then announced a plan to buy unlimited amounts of 10-year JGBs at 0.25% for three consecutive days from Tuesday, deploying the most powerful weapon in its armory to defend its yield target.
“Markets are putting the BOJ to test, so the central bank has no choice but to keep offering unlimited bond buying,” said Takafumi Yamawaki, head of Japan fixed income research at JPMorgan Securities.
“If yields are allowed to move above 0.25%, investors will think the BOJ has tolerated a rise above that level. That makes it harder for the BOJ to carry on with yield curve control.”
Under yield curve control (YCC), the BOJ pledges to guide the 10-year JGB yield around 0% as part of efforts to stimulate the economy by keeping borrowing costs low.
The BOJ’s current guidance is that it will allow the 10-year yield to move flexibly around its 0% target as long as it stays below the 0.25% upper limit, though it will take into account not just the level but the speed of any rise in yields.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has repeatedly said the central bank would maintain interest rates at the current ultra-low levels, given the fragile economic recovery and as inflation remains well below its 2% target.
Growing complaints from politicians over the weak yen, which is inflating Japan’s already rising import costs, may complicate the BOJ’s efforts to keep yields ultra-low, analysts say.
The dollar has rallied over 7% against the yen so far in March, its biggest monthly gain in over five years.
The BOJ is caught in a dilemma. By capping rates at zero, it is fueling yen declines that may hurt the economy by pushing up the costs for households and companies.
“Making offers for unlimited bond buying too frequently may cast doubt over the feasibility of yield curve control,” said Shotaro Kugo, an economist at Daiwa Institute of Research.
“It may also draw unwanted public attention over the weak yen, so the BOJ probably wants to avoid stepping in too often.”

Business,"EXCLUSIVE AMC CEO says more meme-stock powered deals are coming
March 28 (Reuters) - AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N) Chief Executive Adam Aron said the movie-theater chain would embark on more ""transformational"" deals to capitalize on the interest of retail investors following its bet on a troubled gold and silver mine operator.
AMC unveiled a $27.9 million investment for a 22% stake in Hycroft Mining Holding Corp (HYMC.O) about two weeks ago, an unusual deal for a company operating more than 900 theaters worldwide that raised eyebrows among market observers.
AMC's investment called upon a $1.8 billion ""war chest"" it raised in 2021 by selling its shares in the open market, in part on the back of retail investors who turned it into a popular 'meme' stock.
Aron said in a phone interview from a limousine in Los Angeles en route to the Academy Awards on Sunday that AMC's investment in Hycroft had done well from the start. AMC bought Hycroft shares at $1.07, and they were trading at $1.32 last week.
""I'd like to think there will be more third-party external M&A announcements going forward where AMC can reach for the stars and intriguing investments that have potentially attractive returns,"" Aron told Reuters.
AMC's stock in mid-March had fallen to around $14 but rebounded to more than $20 following the Hycroft investment.
Hycroft, which was on the verge of bankruptcy prior to a cash infusion from AMC and longtime precious-metals investor Eric Sprott, said on Friday it had subsequently raised nearly $195 million through open-market stock sales as other investors followed Aron's lead.
Aron said he expects AMC's investment, which includes shares and warrants, to be ""lucrative."" The deal was disclosed March 15, the day after Aron's tour of the company's mining operations in Northern Nevada outside Winnemucca, not far from the site of the annual Burning Man arts and music festival.
Some analysts questioned AMC's investment, expressing concern that the bet is far afield from the company's core competency and wondering whether the money could be better spent repaying the chain's debt, which exceeded $5 billion at the end of 2021.
""TRANSFORMATIONAL M&A""
Aron defended the bet on Hycroft in the Reuters interview, arguing that it drew on AMC's own experience skirting bankruptcy less than two years ago, and pointing out that it had the support of retail investors.
""Transformational M&A is mandatory. Our shareholder base has given us capital to deploy with the clear expectation that we are ... going to do exciting things with the money they entrusted to us,"" Aron said.
He added that the nearly $28 million investment was small relative to AMC's total cash, and that the company would still strengthen and expand its core business. He cited AMC's recent acquisition of former Arclight and Pacific cinema locations, and said the company had plans to add more premium screens at existing theaters and retire some of its debt.
Aron said Hycroft is a company with solid assets that faced a liquidity crisis that reminded him of AMC's dire straits not long ago. Sprott's involvement buoyed Aron's confidence, he said.
""While the Hycroft investment is pretty far from home, it does rely on a core competency of our company to understand balance sheets, and raising cash, and solving liquidity problems,"" Aron said.
SHAREHOLDER FEEDBACK
New deals will not necessarily be so out of the mainstream for AMC, Aron said, pointing to the company's recent decision to launch a co-branded credit card and its move to sell branded popcorn at retail establishments.
The common denominator, he said, will be feedback from shareholders. He now tweets nearly once a day and follows about 2,500 AMC retail investors on the social-media website.
Aron's tweets have been read more than 200 million times since April, he said. He added he has also hosted sneak previews of films for some of these investors, and expects to do perhaps a dozen more of them this year. On earnings calls, AMC now takes questions from retail investors in addition to securities analysts.
That's a shift from the traditional conference calls and road shows that companies have relied upon for communicating with institutional shareholders.
""What's different is not the need to communicate with shareholders. What's different is who the shareholders are,"" Aron said."
Business,"Orsted sells 50% of British wind farm to French consortium
COPENHAGEN, March 28 (Reuters) - Denmark's Orsted (ORSTED.CO) said on Monday it had agreed to sell half of the Hornsea 2 project in Britain, which will become the world's biggest offshore wind farm, to a French consortium for 3 billion pounds ($3.94 billion).
The deal is consistent with the Danish energy giant's strategy of selling off large stakes in operational wind parks to invest the capital in new projects.
The French consortium comprises AXA IM Alts, a unit of France's biggest insurer AXA (AXAF.PA), and Credit Agricole Assurances, which will each own 25% it said.
Renewable and low-carbon energy businesses are attracting high valuations from cash-rich investors who expect steady growth in the market as policymakers seek alternatives to fossil fuels.
The stake will be funded through a combination of equity and a senior multi-tranche staple financing package, which has been structured by Orsted and is provided by 30 banks including Denmark's export credit agency.
Hornsea 2 is located 90 kilometres (56 miles) off the Yorkshire coast in the North Sea with a capacity of 1.3 gigawatts (GW), providing power to more than 1.3 million homes. The park is due to become fully operational in 2022.

Business,"Morning Bid: King cash is naked
A look at the day ahead in markets from Julien Ponthus.
Storing wealth in cash is clearly a counter-intuitive call when inflation is surging towards double-digit figures for the first time in a generation.
Yet, many investors are doing just that: BoFA said $13.2 billion was moved into cash last week and cash positions by fund managers earlier this month reached their highest levels since the pandemic market crash of March 2020. read more
BofA analysts also warned that commodity prices were on track for their biggest increase in over a century while government bonds were set for their worst year since 1949 as central banks raise interest rates to tame surging inflation.
With equity markets losing more than 5% so far this quarter, many investors may feel vindicated in deserting risky stock markets where dividends and capital gains are looking less attractive compared to fast-rising government bond yields.
Yields on 10-year Treasuries have risen nearly 40% so far this month to 2.5% while in Germany, the Bund is closing to 0.6% and moving further away from negative territory which was its home for the past three years.
The war in Ukraine, hard-pressured supply chains, a resurgent pandemic amid buoyant inflation is making this monetary tightening cycle particularly hard to manoeuvre.
The picture, this last Monday morning of March 2022, is blurry as ever.
The yen extended its descent to a six-year low after the Bank of Japan stepped into the market to stop government bond yields from rising and Asian shares retreated as a coronavirus lockdown in Shanghai weighed on sentiment.

""We are considering investment in companies ranging from those that are big in scale to those that are small,"" Co-CEO of SK Hynix Park Jung-ho, who is also CEO of SK Square, said at the latter's annual shareholders meeting.

March 25 (Reuters) - As a tumultuous quarter approaches its end, markets will watch U.S. and euro zone data to gauge just how aggressive central banks might get in their fight against inflation.
Also in focus will be Europe's dilemma whether or not to sanction Russian energy exports, potentially causing further price surges and economic difficulty.
Here's your week ahead in markets from Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Alun John in Hong Kong, Sujata Rao, Tommy Wilkes and Dhara Ranasinghe in London.
Is the Federal Reserve's aggressive trajectory for tightening monetary policy too hawkish, or not hawkish enough? Friday's March U.S. jobs report might show.
Economists polled by Reuters expect 450,000 new jobs were created, versus 678,000 in February.
Hiring far above those estimates will strengthen the case for a 50 basis-point interest rate hike in May. After all, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has signalled readiness to make a big move if needed. read more
Despite that, the S&P 500 has managed to nearly halve its year-to-date losses. But watch the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which is getting close to inversion as investors fret about a Fed-induced recession. The bond market rarely gets it wrong. read more
Targeting Russian energy, as the United States and Britain have done, is one of the most powerful levers the European Union could pull to punish Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. But it remains a divisive choice for the bloc which relies on Russia for 40% of its gas and reeling from a surge in fuel prices.
But as pressure grows to announce a ban, there's been a new twist -- President Vladimir Putin's demand that ""unfriendly"" countries need to pay for gas in roubles is raising yet more concerns about Europe's energy crunch. 
EU leaders could soon agree to buy gas jointly and secure additional U.S. gas supplies. But in the meantime, the debate is causing unease in all kinds of quarters. Oil producing group OPEC, for one, has warned the move could hurt consumers. When first estimates of March euro zone inflation emerge on Friday, they may test the European Central Bank's narrative that there's no rush to raise interest rates. 
Inflation is already at a record high 5.9% and could hit 7% in the coming months. Given the ECB target of 2%, it's unsurprising that some officials are urging one or even two rate moves this year.
A strong inflation print will strengthen their case. But bond markets too suggest higher rates are coming, having priced five moves of 10 bps each by year-end.
Germany's two-year bond yield is up 30 bps in March, set for its biggest monthly rise since 2011. Having spent years deep in negative yield territory amid ECB bond buying to boost inflation, it is fast approaching 0%. That's significant.
The first quarter of 2022 was one most investors would prefer to forget. Except of course those trading oil, metals or grains, who would have rejoiced in Brent crude soaring over 50%, and a 30% gain for the CRB commodities index.
It was less rewarding on equities; with a 5% loss, the S&P 500 looks set to break a seven-quarter winning streak. Nasdaq euro zone stocks fared worse while Chinese markets had to cope with renewed COVID-linked lockdowns in many cities.
Bond markets hit milestones unseen, in some cases, for decades. The 140 basis-point rise in two-year U.S. yields is the biggest since mid-1984; the German equivalent will post its largest quarterly rise since 2011.
Unsurprising, given central bankers' acknowledgement that inflation is not after all transitory and interest rates need to rise. Global inflation will hit 6.3% this quarter, the fastest rise in a quarter century, JPMorgan estimates.
Finally, pity those who failed to exit Russia investments on time -- with the country being ejected from equity and bond indexes, they will need to mark their holdings to zero.

March 28 (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions in Germany in the first three months of 2022 have dropped 10% from the same period in 2021 in what has been the slowest start to a year since 2016 due to market uncertainty caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Equity capital markets in the euro zone's biggest economy have been hit harder as market jitters have led to a total dearth of deals with no initial public offerings (IPOs) or convertible offerings recorded so far this year, according to Refinitiv data.
""It is unlikely that companies will choose to list before Easter, even unlikely before the summer given current market conditions,"" said Armin von Falkenhayn, head of corporate and investment banking in Germany, Austria and Switzerland at Bank of America (BAC.N).
German equity capital markets raised only $1 billion so far this year, down 88% compared with the first quarter of 2021.
But appetite for M&A deals remains strong even if boardrooms have become more risk-averse.
""Unlike at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, the M&A market has definitely not come to a standstill and projects are continuing. But parties are examining very carefully how the conflict may affect each company,"" said Tibor Kossa, co-head of German and Austrian M&A at Goldman Sachs (GS.N).
While the Ukraine crisis has affected only around 1-2% of German companies' sales, ""the war and its longer-term consequences absorb a lot of management capacity,"" said Berthold Mueller, chairman of DACH investment banking at Jefferies.
Yet amid prevailing caution to begin new processes, some auctions that were launched before the war managed to get to the finish line.
One such example was Siemens' (SIEGn.DE) $1.3 billion carve-out of its mail and parcel logistics business, which was sold to Hamburg-based Koerber (KRBR.UL) in February and led to consumer products and services accounting for one-third of German target M&A in the first quarter. read more
Other deals in the technology sector contributed to 31% of German target M&A including the purchase by Italian infrastructure and transport services firm Atlantia (ATL.MI) of Siemens' traffic software solutions business, Yunex.
Strong growth in the technology sector contributed to an increase in mid-market deal activity to its highest year-to-date total since 2015, according to Refinitiv data.
""Private equity remains open to acquisitions and transactions can continue to be funded,"" said Christopher Droege, co-head of German and Austrian M&A at Goldman Sachs.
EYES ON TRANSATLANTIC TIE-UPS
One sector that seems resilient to the backdrop of war is telecommunications – arguably a necessity for information flow in times of crisis.
Earlier this month, Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) launched the sale of its towers business and is collecting indicative offers together with adviser Goldman Sachs, in a deal that could value the business at close to 18 billion euros ($19.86 billion). read more
Dealmakers say there are intense dialogues with corporate clients as well as private equity and the deal pipeline for the rest of the year looks intact.
Transatlantic tie-ups could increase as the European landscape becomes more challenging.
""In the future we expect that German companies looking for takeovers will orient themselves increasingly towards North America since the growth gap between Europe and the United States is likely to widen further in the current environment,"" Goldman's Kossa said.
Nevertheless, dealmaking during wartime remains hard to stomach for some parties that prefer to wait for peacetime.
""A buyer cannot go before their board of directors and pretend this war does not exist. The question is how long this situation will last. That is why many companies tend to wait until the situation clears up,"" said Jefferies' Mueller.

Business,"NatWest returns to majority private control as it buys back £1.2bn in shares
UK government sells more of stake in group formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland at a loss over 2008 price
NatWest Group has returned to majority private ownership after it agreed to buy back £1.2bn of shares from the UK government, more than 13 years after the company was bailed out by taxpayers at the height of the financial crisis.
The company, formerly known as Royal Bank of Scotland Group (RBS), said it had agreed to make an off-market purchase of 550m shares, or 4.91% of its share capital, from HM Treasury at Friday’s closing price of 220.5p, in a statement to the stock market on Monday.
The deal, the fifth since the bailout, will be completed on Wednesday, leaving the government with a 48.1% stake in the banking group, a symbolic moment after more than 13 years of majority state ownership. At the peak, the government owned 84% of the group. 
Gordon Brown’s Labour government announced the £46bn bailout in October 2008, after the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers caused chaos across the global financial system. As well as RBS, the bailout also included Lloyds TSB and HBOS, which later combined to form Lloyds Banking Group. Lloyds bought back the last of its shares from the government in 2017.
The path back to majority private ownership has been longer for NatWest Group, which became a symbol of the pre-financial crisis excesses of British banking, after a series of disastrous expansions under its chief executive, Fred “The Shred” Goodwin, who was later stripped of his knighthood after public ire. The chief executive, Alison Rose, ditched the RBS Group brand in 2020.
Rose said on Monday: “Reducing government ownership below 50% is an important milestone for NatWest and a further demonstration of the progress we are making.”
The latest NatWest share purchase price represents a substantial loss for the taxpayer, which paid an average of 500p a share in 2008. The government’s remaining stake will be worth about £11.9bn at Friday’s closing price.
John Glen, the economic secretary to the Treasury under the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: “This sale means that the government is no longer the majority owner of NatWest Group and is therefore an important landmark in our plan to return the bank to the private sector. We will continue to prioritise delivering value for money for the taxpayer as we take forward this plan.”
The government had planned to sell the entire public stake in NatWest by 2023-24, but delayed the share sales because of the pandemic.
The Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent budget watchdog, said last week that the government had recouped £134bn from its financial crisis interventions, compared with an outlay of £137bn.
That would leave the government with a cash surplus of £17.1bn for the financial crisis measures. However, that does not include the cost of borrowing to fund the bailout, with an estimated £47.7bn in extra debt interest costs, meaning the crisis has cost the government £31bn in cash terms alone.
Simon Adamson, the chief executive of the debt ratings agency CreditSights, said the share sale was “an important milestone in NatWest’s re-privatisation”, albeit one with no “significant practical consequences”."
Business,"Bank of England expects UK energy shock on the scale of the 1970s
Consumers and businesses will come under severe pressure from cost of living squeeze, says governor
Britain’s economy is expected to suffer a growth slowdown amid the biggest single shock from energy prices since the 1970s, the governor of the Bank of England has warned.
Andrew Bailey said there were signs of slowing demand from consumers and businesses as they come under heavy pressure from the cost of living squeeze, with soaring prices for gas, electricity and other goods and services.
“The shock from energy prices this year will be larger than any single year in the 1970s,” he said at an event held by the Bruegel thinktank in Brussels on Monday. “The caveat is that the 1970s had a succession of years and we very much hope that would not be the case now. But as a single year, this is a very, very big shock.”
Threadneedle Street said earlier this month that inflation could reach 8% this spring after a sharp rise in household gas and electricity bills due on Friday. With inflation already surging before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it said global energy prices being pushed higher by the war could drive UK inflation close to 10% later this year.
The central bank has responded by raising interest rates, which now stand at 0.75% after a 0.25 point increase at its March policy meeting, as it put concerns over high inflation ahead of the impact on economic growth to stop the current bout of rising prices from becoming more persistent in future. The Bank has a target to steer inflation close to 2%.
Bailey suggested on Monday that the cost of living squeeze was likely to hit the UK’s economic growth rate as households and companies tighten their belts due to the increase in the price of energy and other goods and services.
“We expect it to cause growth and demand to slow. We’re beginning to see the evidence of that in both consumer and business surveys,” he said, suggesting that weaker rates of growth could lead to a cooling of inflation without the need for significant interest rate hikes from the central bank.
“We expect that this pressure on demand will weigh down on domestically generated inflation. For that reason we do expect inflation to return to target, two years or so out from now.”
The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s economic forecaster, last week downgraded its 2022 growth forecasts from 6% to 3.8% while warning that the highest rate of inflation in four decades would hit consumer demand.
Analysts expect the Bank of England’s monetary policy committee to raise interest rates to 1% when it next meets in early May. While financial markets point to its key interest rate rising to 2% by the end of the year, some economists have suggested a weaker growth outlook would reduce the need for such a sharp rise in borrowing costs.
Bailey said there were “risks to the outlook for inflation from both sides,” with a high degree of uncertainty facing the UK economy.
“We’ve got a pandemic followed by a European war, in any scale that is a very difficult position to be in for policy.”"

Sunak learns hard way UK public don’t want an Osborne reboot
A decade of austerity swung opinion behind state intervention, while work is no longer a guarantee to lift people out of poverty
Where did it all go wrong for Rishi Sunak? The most popular chancellor in four decades now pilloried for a spring statement which failed to meet the challenge of the worst hit to living standards since the Suez crisis.
Attacked for promising tax cuts while stealthily driving up the tax burden to the highest level since Clement Attlee was prime minister in the late 1940s, criticised for putting Instagram moments ahead of the serious task at hand, here was an out-of-touch ivory tower politician who would allow living costs to rise faster than pensions and benefits. It was the mini-budget to please no one.
In an earlier time the story would have been very different. Conservative chancellors promising tax cuts would normally enjoy support from their own party. Prioritising the public finances over benefit handouts should be a surefire winner for any would-be Tory leadership contender.
In the arid desert of support for Sunak, it was noticeable that George Osborne was among the few politicians willing to offer him praise, gushing that the Conservatives had been given back a “long-term economic plan” based on controlling spending, reducing the deficit and cutting taxes.
The trouble is the times have changed. Now is not the moment for an Osborne reboot of “fixing the roof while the sun is shining”. In case the chancellor hadn’t noticed, the economic weather has turned – with more than a million people expected to be pushed into absolute poverty.
A decade of austerity cuts to public services has swung public opinion behind more state intervention, not less, with the response to Covid highlighting how much can be done during extreme shocks to the economy.
That Sunak’s spring statement fell so badly flat highlights three things: how much has changed since Osborne was chancellor, how badly Sunak has judged the cost of living crisis and how poorly equipped the neoliberal toolbox is to deal with the big challenges facing the British economy.
A decade earlier the Conservatives had been on a branding exercise to claim the mantle of the workers’ party, taking aim at benefit scroungers to boost employment and discourage a life on handouts.
Sunak’s approach is in that vein – promoting work as the best engine to lift people out of poverty. Having cut benefits by £20 per week last October despite all the warnings, he was hardly going to turn back now.
However, there are serious problems with this approach when hard work isn’t making life any easier while living costs soar, and after a decade of economic mismanagement from the party of government.
The Resolution Foundation estimates average pay levels are on course to be just £18 per week higher in 2027 than they were in 2008, after adjusting for inflation. The upwards path for wages achieved in the years before the financial crisis has stalled in the decade since.
Far from levelling up or building back better, typical household incomes are forecast to fall by 2% between Boris Johnson’s election landslide in 2019 and 2025, making his the worst parliament on record for living standards.
The Tory advert for the world of work could hardly be worse. Failure to take action on workers’ rights has led to the scandal of 800 seafarers being fired without notice at P&O Ferries. Precariousness of employment and low pay are endemic.
Refusing to boost benefits ignores that millions of the lowest-paid workers are forced to rely on them.
Official figures show as many as 40% out of the 5.6 million universal credit claimants are in work. While the government is raising the minimum wage by 6.6% to £9.50 an hour this April, benefit cuts made last autumn and tax rises this spring mean many on low-pay will still be worse off.
Most people living in poverty are either in work or live in a working household, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. As many as one in eight workers are now in poverty – about 4 million people. That is a rise of about 1.5 million from the late 1990s when one in 11 people in poverty had a job.
While research suggests poverty rates fall sharply when people move into work, it’s clear that even sustained employment does not eliminate a life below the breadline in 21st century Britain. An action plan to improve the outcomes of the economy for workers is needed.
This requires a twin-track approach. Firstly, additional help for the poorest with surging energy bills and the rising cost of a weekly shop. It took Boris Johnson less than 24 hours from the spring statement to admit this might be necessary.
Secondly, longer term measures to get the economy moving and provide access to well-paid, secure employment. This should start with an employment bill to ban exploitative “fire and rehire” practices of the type used by bosses at P&O, as well as ending zero-hours contracts.
A decade ago, the public did not believe Labour when the party insisted the best way to cut the deficit was to boost the economy with a Keynesian burst of public investment. Today, the shoe is firmly on the other foot. The Tory argument that the state must step aside and let businesses and workers find their own way through the latest economic shocks falls entirely flat."
Science,"Lithium mining may be putting some flamingos in Chile at risk
The quest to produce “greener” batteries may take a toll on biodiversity in some regions
Flamingos may be a kind of canary in the coal mine when it comes to warning of a hidden cost of green technologies. Lithium mining appears to be a major threat to the iconic pink birds that rely on ecologically fragile salt flats bordering the high Andes Mountains. Mining of the metal and climate change together are causing the decline of two flamingo species found only on Andean plateaus, researchers report March 9 in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B.
Lithium, used in lightweight, rechargeable batteries for electric cars, smartphones and other items, is expected to play a major role in helping fight climate change. Within the next decade or so, global demand for the metal is estimated to quadruple (SN: 5/7/19). The new finding highlights that the quest for lithium is not without drawbacks, fitting into a growing body of research revealing lithium mining’s adverse impacts on ecosystems.
One of the world’s richest deposits of lithium spans parts of Chile, Bolivia and Argentina, an area sometimes referred to as the “lithium triangle.” The region is also home to the Atacama Desert plateau, one of the driest places on Earth, and hosts a series of shallow, salt flat lake ecosystems that depend on the limited water supply. These ecologically sensitive “salares” nourish cyanobacteria and diatom algae, which in turn are eaten by three types of flamingos, half of the world’s flamingo species. 
This fragile ecosystem is now in an existential conflict because lithium refinement ponds and other industrial mining processes use a massive amount of water — an estimated 400,000 liters per ton of lithium, says Nathan Senner, a population ecologist at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. 
And there’s only so much water to go around. “This is literally the driest desert in the world,” Senner says. “Much of that [mining] water has to come from groundwater.”
Senner — with ecologist Jorge Gutiérrez of the University of Extremadura in Spain and bird ecologist Juan Navedo of the Austral University of Chile in Valdivia and others — gathered over 30 years’ worth of flamingo surveys. The researchers also examined satellite imagery tracking water surface area changes in five salt flats in the Chilean portion of the lithium triangle. And the team tracked cyanobacteria levels using satellite data, along with climatic factors that could influence the salt flats’ water levels, such as precipitation and temperature. 
Senner and his colleagues found that since 1984, the five salares have each shrunk by at least 30 percent in surface area, partially due to increased evaporation, which is influenced by climatic factors like wind, humidity and temperature.  The team also found that there’s a great deal of variability in water level between years. And those fluctuations appear to strongly dictate the number of flamingos in a given year by determining the availability of the birds’ food.
Flamingo counts “can change by literally thousands of individuals across just a couple of years,” Senner says.
The long-term drying trend from climate change, which may reduce overall availability of food for flamingos, is being exacerbated by ever-thirsty lithium mining, the team says. And it’s leaving a mark on two of the flamingo species: the Andean (Phoenicoparrus andinus) and the James’ (P. jamesi) flamingos, whose populations declined 12 percent and 10 percent over 11 years, respectively, in Chile’s Salar de Atacama. This is a loss of hundreds of birds.
The team ties this decline directly to lithium mining. As the mining ponds grew in the Salar, nearby James’ and Andean flamingo populations dwindled in tight correlation. Water loss from new mining activity may be a major culprit. Between 1986 and 2018, the groundwater pumping for lithium production increased from zero to 1.8 cubic meters per second. Simultaneously, the Salar lost about five football fields’ worth of surface area every year.
Though the declines didn’t occur over the entire region, the findings are especially concerning for these two species because they don’t live anyplace else in the world. “They are entirely wedded to these saline lakes,” Senner says. 
Flamingo declines and salar drying could have reverberating effects on people too since the popular, flamingo-based ecotourism in the region would probably suffer, the team says.
“Science-based conservation management guidelines might still allow future preservation of some key hypersaline systems in the region,” says Mattia Saccò, an ecologist at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, who was not involved with the research. 
As the need for lithium is set to rise for use in technologies like electric vehicles, the threat to the flamingos may only increase.
“It’s a real conundrum because obviously no one is going to argue that climate change is not this monster that we need to contend with,” Senner says. Still, as this study suggests, the technologies that could help humankind combat climate change may have their own suite of negative ecological effects. Being aware of those consequences is going to be crucial to weighing the costs and benefits of such solutions, Senner says.
Finding ways to reduce those ecological costs could be one helpful way forward, he says, particularly by making lithium mining more water efficient or improving the ability to recycle lithium from used batteries. "
Science,"Some E. coli set off viral grenades inside nearby bacteria
A toxin called colibactin awakens dormant viruses embedded in bacterial DNA
Some bacteria can trigger unexploded viral grenades in neighboring bacteria’s DNA.
Certain Escherichia coli bacteria, including some that live in human intestines, make a chemical called colibactin. That chemical awakens dormant viruses inside nearby bacteria, sometimes leading to their destruction, researchers report February 23 in Nature.
This type of biological warfare among bacteria hasn’t been described before. “It’s an interesting strategy, and it’s also a dangerous strategy,” says Heather Hendrickson, an evolutionary microbiologist at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, who was not involved in the work.
Colibactin producers must creep up on their bacterial enemies and trigger the unexploded ordinance hiding in the enemies’ DNA. Those grenades are prophages — bacteria-infecting viruses that have inserted themselves into their hosts’ DNA, where they hide out harmless and dormant until something triggers their awakening. That something, in this case, is DNA damage caused by colibactin.
When colibactin dings DNA, a bacterial repair system called the SOS response kicks in, chemical biologist Emily Balskus and colleagues found. “What many phages have done is to tap into that response,” says Balskus, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Harvard University.
“It’s a signal for them to move out of this dormant lifestyle and awaken to kill their host and move on to find a new host,” she says. Once phages wake up, they replicate and burst out of the host cell, destroying it.
But once these viral grenades go off, they can infect other bacteria, potentially exposing the attacking bacteria and other close-by microbes to biological shrapnel.
Humans might also get caught in the cross fire. Researchers already knew that colibactin can cause damage to human DNA that may lead to colon cancer. But why the bacteria would use the chemical against people wasn’t known.
The new research suggests that E. coli may not be producing colibactin to assault its human hosts, but as a countermeasure against other microbes, Hendrickson says (SN: 12/14/21). “It’s easy to forget that there’s this continual conversation and warfare going on between bacteria, and we might not be the focus of their activities.”
Among bacteria, colibactin isn’t usually a lethal weapon. In most bacteria that Balskus and her colleagues examined, colibactin caused DNA damage, but the bacteria were able to repair the wounds. That may be because colibactin is an unstable chemical that quickly degrades before it can break enough DNA to do irreparable harm, Balskus says. Some bacteria also make other chemicals that defuse colibactin before it can damage DNA, her team found. Only bacteria that have unexploded prophages in their DNA and no other defenses were vulnerable to colibactin-producing bacteria in laboratory dishes.
Because colibactin decays quickly, “it suggests this is a very short-range communication,” says Michael Dougherty, a microbiome researcher at the University of Florida in Gainesville who was not involved in the study. “Maybe it could have an effect when bacteria are forming biofilms where you have trillions of bacteria stacked on top of each other.”
Colibactin may not be the only factor involved in exploding neighboring bacteria, says Dougherty’s University of Florida colleague Christian Jobin. Balskus’ team did not demonstrate that colibactin alone could detonate prophages. Perhaps something else about the colibactin-producing bacterium’s presence is required to kick off the fireworks, he suggests.
The researchers don’t yet know whether colibactin can trigger prophages when bacteria are in their natural habitats, such as human and other animal intestines. And perhaps awakening the viruses is an accident, Balskus speculates.
“Maybe [colibactin] didn’t really evolve to kill. Maybe its primary ecological function involves doing something else,” she says. What that might be is a mystery that Balskus and her colleagues are working to solve."
Science,"Africa’s fynbos plants hold their ground with the world’s thinnest roots
The fynbos shrubland weaponizes its very thin roots in the race to suck up nutrients
Some plant roots draw a line in the sand — literally.
In South Africa, you can move between cool, green forest and sunbaked shrubland in a single stride. These narrow borders between dramatically different ecosystems are maintained by intense competition between plants’ roots, new research suggests.
Fynbos — a type of species-rich shrubland found only on the far southern tip of Africa — has the thinnest roots by far of any plant community in the world, researchers report in the March 1 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. These nutrient-gobbling roots, plus some fire-encouraging adaptations, help turn the fynbos into an austere realm where only fynbos plants can survive. 
Interested in what factors organize nature at very broad scales, ecologist Lars Hedin and his colleagues wanted to look at places where environmental changes over time can flip the ecosystem between two distinct states. 
Enter the fynbos. It’s a low, shrubby habitat home to mind-blowing plant diversity: more than 7,000 species, most of which are found nowhere else in the world (SN: 8/24/2004). 
“It’s one of the most floristically biodiverse systems in the world,” says Hedin, of Princeton University. “It’s essentially as diverse as a tropical forest.”
But right next to this hot, flower-filled wonderland — with the same climate and underlying geologic composition — is the lush Afro-temperate forest, flourishing with tall trees and moss, but fewer species overall. 
“The boundary is as sharp as one meter. It’s like a binary, zero to one transition,” says study coauthor Mingzhen Lu, an ecologist at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico. This is far narrower than the transition zone between savanna and tropical rainforest, he says, which can occur over many kilometers. 
To investigate what underlies these sharp borders, the team compared root samples from both fynbos and forest systems. They also conducted transplant experiments, moving Afro-temperate forest plants to the fynbos and tracking their growth over four years. The researchers kept fynbos plant roots away from the transplants and manipulated nutrient levels in some plots to unveil limiting factors for the forest plants.
When kept away from fynbos roots or offered more nitrogen, forest trees grew five times as fast as those that experienced competition or nutritional disadvantage, the team found. That suggests the fynbos plants keep invading plants away by monopolizing nutrient access. 
Below the surface, the story becomes even clearer. The fynbos plants have long, thin roots that act like nutrient-seeking missiles, snaking through the soil where other roots can’t reach. 
“That’s a competitive advantage,” Hedin says. “That’s an underground weapon.”
The median root tip thickness in the fynbos plant community is about 0.1 millimeters, or around one-quarter to one-half the thickness of any other root system in the world. “The thickest fynbos roots are still thinner than the thinnest [Afro-temperate] forest roots,” Lu says.
Compared to the forest plants, fynbos roots are also 10 times as long. A gram of some fynbos plants’ root tissue – about the mass of a thumbtack – can stretch over 15 football field lengths of territory.
The researchers think that the fynbos creates “nutritional misery” for any nonfynbos plant, making the soil around the fynbos nutrient poor with their hyper-efficient roots. Also, a large proportion of fynbos shrubs and grasses are highly flammable, making the ecosystem prone to particularly intense fires. The fires burn so hot that they volatilize soil nitrogen into the air, removing those nutrients from the area too. Rather than engineering their surroundings to enhance nutrient levels, the plants may be doing the opposite — sabotaging the nutrient supply — to give themselves the upper hand against would-be encroachers.
“You can try to invade, you’re not going to stand a chance,” Hedin says. 
The fynbos-forest borders waver over the years between fire cycles, with the wet forest mostly rebuffing the flames and the fynbos eventually casting out trespassers.
A long prevailing idea about large ecological communities, Hedin says, is that they are largely driven by nonliving factors, such as climate, topography and geology, where organisms adapt to localized conditions. But in this case — and maybe others — “alternative stable states” arise from a war waging between organisms.
The findings demonstrate how pieces of this puzzle — fire, plant traits above and below ground and feedbacks between soil and plant, to start — illuminate the processes behind the creation and maintenance of the two coexisting vegetation zones, says Gerlinde de Deyn, a soil ecologist at Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands not involved with the research.
The thinness of the fynbos plants is “striking,” de Deyn says, but the role of root-associated fungi in the ecosystem needs to be addressed. These fungi are normally heavily involved in soil nutrient cycling and could be contributing to the roots’ efficient nutrient uptake, rather than the roots doing it all by themselves. 
In the fynbos, there may also be lessons for how root traits help or hinder the spread of invasive plants, Lu says."
Science,"50 years ago, freezing sperm faced scientific skepticism
Excerpt from the February 26, 1972 issue of Science News
Many men contemplating vasectomies have been depositing a quantity of their semen with sperm banks where, for a fee, it is frozen and stored.… There is wide disagreement on the length of time that sperm may be frozen and then thawed and used successfully to impregnate a woman, with estimates ranging from only 16 months to as much as 10 years.
The ability to freeze sperm has helped make parenthood possible for millions of people, including infertile or same-sex couples and people who have undergone cancer treatment (SN: 6/19/21, p. 16). Sperm-freezing methods have improved since the 1970s, and studies have shown that frozen sperm can remain viable for many years, even decades. The rate of live births from sperm frozen for up to 15 years at a sperm bank in China was similar to rates from sperm stored for much shorter periods, scientists reported in 2019. In 2013, U.S. researchers reported the birth of healthy twins who were conceived using sperm that had been frozen for about 40 years."
Science,"Babies may use saliva sharing to figure out relationships
Actions like sharing bites of food or kissing may cue young children into close bonds
Young children are always watching. That includes when people swap spit through actions like sharing food — helping the tots work out who is in close relationships with one another, a study suggests.
Typically, people are more likely to share things that can lead to an exchange of saliva, such as kisses or an ice cream cone, with family members or close friends than with an acquaintance or colleague. As a result, intimate actions that share saliva can be markers of a “thick relationship,” or people who have enduring attachments to each other, such as parents, siblings, extended family or best friends, says Ashley Thomas, a developmental psychologist at MIT.
Young children often pick up on social cues from the people around them (SN: 1/30/14). So to see if kids, including babies and toddlers, might use saliva sharing as a cue for intimate bonds, Thomas and colleagues turned to experiments of people engaging with puppets.
When shown a puppet seemingly crying in a video, children as young as about 8 months old were more likely to look at an adult who had previously shared saliva with the puppet — either directly or by sharing food — rather than another adult who hadn’t, the team reports in the Jan. 21 Science.
Researchers, of course, can’t know exactly what babies are thinking. But tracking where they look is one way to get a hint. The idea is not that young children might be expecting an adult to comfort the puppet, Thomas says. Instead, the researchers expected that the young children would look toward the person that they expect to move first when the puppet expresses distress, and that would be the person who has a closer relationship with the toy, she says.
For some of the experiments, the team showed 8- to 10-month-old babies or 16- to 18-month-old toddlers videos of a woman sharing an orange slice with a puppet. A second video depicted another woman and the puppet playing with a ball. During a final video that showed the puppet seemingly crying while seated between the two women, the kids’ eyes were drawn to the woman who had shared the orange slice — a sign the tots may have been expecting her to react.
The team saw similar results when one woman interacted with two puppets. The woman stuck her finger in her mouth and then one puppet’s mouth to share her saliva. For the other, she touched only her forehead and then the puppet’s forehead. Infants and toddlers spent more time looking at the puppet that had swapped saliva after the woman showed distress.
Older children ages 5 to 7 years also picked up on saliva sharing as a mark of close relationships. Kids in that age group predicted that people sharing utensils or bites of food might be family while those sharing toys or divvying up food could be either friends or family.
It’s unclear how the findings relate to the daily lives of young children. Future experiments could switch out actresses in the study for family members or teachers to better understand the role saliva may play in how infants and toddlers distinguish different types of relationships. Other cues, such as hugging, may also play a role, Thomas says.
The study also focused only on children living in the United States, and didn’t compare across cultures. Still, the findings are exciting, says Darby Saxbe, a clinical developmental psychologist and co-director of the University of Southern California Center for the Changing Family in Los Angeles. It would be interesting, she says, to figure out whether kids from groups of people that have different hygiene or eating traditions react differently in the same situations."
Science,"Ancient human visitors complicate the Falkland Islands wolf’s origin story
Indigenous people arrived on the islands centuries before Europeans
The enigmatic, now-extinct Falkland Islands wolf had human visitors on the remote archipelago up to 1,070 years ago. The find suggests that Indigenous people could have originally brought the foxlike creatures, also known as the warrah, to the islands.
Scientists have debated how the islands’ only land mammal journeyed to the region: by a long-ago land bridge or with people. But little evidence of a human presence before Europeans arrived in 1690 had been found. Now, traces of ancient fires and hunting show that Indigenous people arrived on the Falkland Islands centuries prior to Europeans, researchers report October 27 in Science Advances. The Yaghan people — historically fire-wielding seafarers who kept foxes as companions — may have been the visitors.
Abrupt spikes in charcoal levels in sediments offer “telltale signs of human arrival” from 1,070 to 620 years ago on New Island, says Kit Hamley, a paleoecologist and archaeologist at the University of Maine in Orono. Those spikes mirror later traces of Europeans’ fires around 250 years ago.
And massive piles of sea lion and penguin bones imply hunting by humans from 745 to 600 years ago, Hamley says. Before being hunted to extinction by Europeans in 1875, the Falkland Islands wolf (Dusicyon australis) also consumed marine predators such as sea lions and penguins, nitrogen levels in two warrah bones and one tooth show.  
The researchers newly dated that tooth and found it to be from 3,860 years ago. That vastly predates the fire-and-bone-pile evidence, leaving a gap “between when the warrah arrives, and when we can definitively say people were there,” Hamley says.
But Indigenous people’s presence up to 1,070 years ago raises new questions about whether the warrah hitchhiked there with earlier human visitors, Hamley says.
Next, Hamley and colleagues plan to partner with the few remaining Yaghan communities in Tierra del Fuego in Argentina to piece together “parts of the story that have been lost or taken away.”"
Science,"A UN report shows climate change’s escalating toll on people and nature
The window to reduce emissions and avoid most disastrous consequences is closing fast, experts say
Neither adaptation by humankind nor mitigation alone is enough to reduce the risk from climate impacts, hundreds of the world’s scientists say. Nothing less than a concerted, global effort to both drastically curb carbon emissions and proactively adapt to climate change can stave off the most disastrous consequences, according to the latest report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.
That dire warning comes as the effects of climate change on people and nature are playing out across the globe in a more widespread and severe manner than previously anticipated. And the most vulnerable communities — often low-income or Indigenous — are being hit the hardest, the report says.
“It’s the strongest rebuttal that we’ve seen yet of this idea that we can just adapt our way out of climate change and we don’t have to mitigate emissions,” says Anne Christianson, the director of international climate policy at the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C., who was not involved in the report.
A consortium of 270 scientists from 67 countries synthesized the report after reviewing over 34,000 studies. Released February 28 as part of the IPCC’s sixth assessment of climate science, the report details how the impacts of climate change are playing out today in different regions, and assessed the capacities of communities and regions to adapt.
Many countries understand the need for climate adaptation. And modern solutions, such as the building of urban gardens or adoption of agroforestry, where implemented, appear to show promise. But, the report finds, efforts to adapt are, by and large, reactionary, small and drastically underfunded. As a result, about 3.3 billion to 3.6 billion people remain highly vulnerable to climate risks such as extreme weather events, sea level rise and food and water shortages. The need for adaptation is greatest — and growing larger — in low-income regions, most notably in parts of Africa, South Asia, small island states and Central and South America.
The report also underscores the importance of involving those who are impacted the most in climate plans. “We can no longer just make these decisions at the highest level; we need to include local stakeholders, Indigenous groups, local communities and those who are most as at risk for climate change, such as women, racial minorities, the elderly and children,” Christianson says.
Last August, a previous report, also part of the IPCC’s sixth assessment, covered the physical science underpinning climate change (SN: 8/9/21). In that report, scientists stated loud and clear that there was no time to waste. By 2030, carbon emissions need to be cut in half, compared with 2017 levels, to prevent global temperatures from climbing 1.5° Celsius above the preindustrial baseline, the report found. Beyond that baseline, the capacity for humankind and nature to adapt severely deteriorates. In a bit of good news, the authors of that 2021 report also found that if all carbon emissions were to cease today, global temperatures would stop rising in about three years, not the 30 to 40 years once thought. In other words, we can make a big difference in very little time.
Still, climate change is already affecting many parts of Earth. And some of the consequences aren’t going away anytime soon. Sea level will continue to rise for decades, driven in part by the runaway melting of Greenland’s ice sheet (SN: 9/30/20). By 2050, sea level along U.S. coastlines will have risen by 25 to 30 centimeters, or roughly one foot, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates.
Extreme weather events and climate-fueled wildfires have already caused mass mortalities of corals and other animals and trees, and pushed entire species toward the brink of extinction (SN: 3/9/21). What’s more, climate change is forcing many people to relocate, as well as detrimentally affecting mental health and spreading disease as vectors such as mosquitoes shift to new habitats (SN: 5/12/20; SN: 10/7/19).
Adaptation is especially needed in cities, which are growing and expected to contain two-thirds of the world’s population by 2050, including climate refugees from elsewhere, the new report finds. Urban communities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to extreme heat waves, urban heat island effects, floods and storm surges (SN: 9/18/21).
Outside of cities, the breakdown of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity severely impacts the people who rely on natural systems for their livelihoods, the report emphasizes. Farmers in the global south are finding it increasingly challenging to grow crops as a result of droughts, heat waves, floods and sea-level rise (SN: 9/24/21). People who make their living fishing are being forced to travel greater distances to pursue species that are altering their natural ranges as ocean temperatures warm.
Key to adapting to these impacts is the restoration and preservation of natural ecosystems, the report states. Conserving 30 to 50 percent of the planet’s land, ocean and freshwater ecosystems will help support biodiversity and enhance climate resilience (SN: 4/22/20). Preserving mangrove forests, for instance, along less developed coastlines sequesters large amounts of carbon and protects against storm surges (SN:5/7/21, SN: 6/4/20).
“The truth is that nature can be our savior,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme, at a February 28 news conference announcing the report’s release. “But only if we save it first.”
Still, the natural world and many of the “services” it provides to humankind, such as carbon storage and flood control, begin to break down more rapidly at about 1.5° C above preindustrial temperatures, the report notes. And the window to prevent that from happening is closing. “We are on a trajectory to losing many of these systems and the services they provide” says Borja Reguero, a coastal science researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz who reviewed the report.
What that means is there is no time to waste. “We simultaneously need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to reduce the risks of climate change and also address losses and damages that are already being experienced,” Adelle Thomas, a climate scientist at the University of the Bahamas in Nassau, said at a February 27 news briefing. Thomas is the lead author of the new report’s chapter on key risks across sectors and regions.
“And we have a very limited amount of time left to do this,” she stressed."
Science,"Smoke from Australia’s intense fires in 2019 and 2020 damaged the ozone layer
Increasingly large blazes threaten to undo decades of work to help Earth’s protective layer
Towers of smoke that rose high into the stratosphere during Australia’s “black summer” fires in 2019 and 2020 destroyed some of Earth’s protective ozone layer, researchers report in the March 18 Science.
Chemist Peter Bernath of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., and his colleagues analyzed data collected in the lower stratosphere during 2020 by a satellite instrument called the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment. It measures how different particles in the atmosphere absorb light at different wavelengths. Such absorption patterns are like fingerprints, identifying what molecules are present in the particles.
The team’s analyses revealed that the particles of smoke, shot into the stratosphere by fire-fueled thunderstorms called pyrocumulonimbus clouds, contained a variety of mischief-making organic molecules (SN: 12/15/20). The molecules, the team reports, kicked off a series of chemical reactions that altered the balances of gases in Earth’s stratosphere to a degree never before observed in 15 years of satellite measurements. That shuffle included boosting levels of chlorine-containing molecules that ultimately ate away at the ozone.
Ozone concentrations in the stratosphere initially increased from January to March 2020, due to similar chemical reactions — sometimes with the contribution of wildfire smoke — that produce ozone  pollution at ground level (SN: 12/8/21). But from April to December 2020, the ozone levels not only fell, but sank below the average ozone concentration from 2005 to 2019.
Earth’s ozone layer shields the planet from much of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation. Once depleted by human emissions of chlorofluorocarbons and other ozone-damaging substances, the layer has been showing signs of recovery thanks to the Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to reduce the atmospheric concentrations of those substances (SN: 2/10/21).
But the increasing frequency of large wildfires due to climate change — and their ozone-destroying potential — could become a setback for that rare climate success story, the researchers say (SN: 3/4/20)."
Science,"Here’s the best timeline yet for the Milky Way’s big events
Our galaxy formed its original disk 2 billion years before its stellar halo
A new analysis of nearly a quarter million stars puts firm ages on the most momentous pages from our galaxy’s life story.
Far grander than most of its neighbors, the Milky Way arose long ago, as lesser galaxies smashed together. Its thick disk — a pancake-shaped population of old stars — originated remarkably soon after the Big Bang and well before most of the stellar halo that envelops the galaxy’s disk, astronomers report March 23 in Nature.
“We are now able to provide a very clear timeline of what happened in the earliest time of our Milky Way,” says astronomer Maosheng Xiang.
He and Hans-Walter Rix, both at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany, studied almost 250,000 subgiants — stars that are growing larger and cooler after using up the hydrogen fuel at their centers. The temperatures and luminosities of these stars reveal their ages, letting the researchers track how different epochs in galactic history spawned stars with different chemical compositions and orbits around the Milky Way’s center.
“There’s just an incredible amount of information here,” says Rosemary Wyse, an astrophysicist at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved with the study. “We really want to understand how our galaxy came to be the way it is,” she says. “When were the chemical elements of which we are made created?”
Xiang and Rix discovered that the Milky Way’s thick disk got its start about 13 billion years ago. That’s just 800 million years after the universe’s birth. The thick disk, which measures 6,000 light-years from top to bottom in the sun’s vicinity, kept forming stars for a long time, until about 8 billion years ago.
During this period, the thick disk’s iron content shot up 30-fold as exploding stars enriched its star-forming gas, the team found. At the dawn of the thick disk era, a newborn star had only a tenth as much iron, relative to hydrogen, as the sun; by the end, 5 billion years later, a thick disk star was three times richer in iron than the sun.
Xiang and Rix also found a tight relation between a thick disk star’s age and iron content. This means gas was thoroughly mixed throughout the thick disk: As time went on, newborn stars inherited steadily higher amounts of iron, no matter whether the stars formed close to or far from the galactic center.
But that’s not all that was happening. As other researchers reported in 2018, another galaxy once hit our own, giving the Milky Way most of the stars in its halo, which engulfs the disk (SN: 11/1/18). Halo stars have little iron.
The new work revises the date of this great galactic encounter: “We found that the merger happened 11 billion years ago,” Xiang says, a billion years earlier than thought. As the intruder’s gas crashed into the Milky Way’s gas, it triggered the creation of so many new stars that our galaxy’s star formation rate reached a record high 11 billion years ago.
The merger also splashed some thick disk stars up into the halo, which Xiang and Rix identified from the stars’ higher iron abundances. These “splash” stars, the researchers found, are at least 11 billion years old, confirming the date of the merger.
The thick disk ran out of gas 8 billion years ago and stopped making stars. Fresh gas around the Milky Way then settled into a thinner disk, which has given birth to stars ever since — including the 4.6-billion-year-old sun and most of its stellar neighbors. The thin disk is about 2,000 light-years thick in our part of the galaxy.
“The Milky Way has been quite quiet for the last 8 billion years,” Xiang says, experiencing no further encounters with big galaxies. That makes it different from most of its peers.
If the thick disk really existed 13 billion years ago, Xiang says, then the new James Webb Space Telescope (SN: 1/24/22) may discern similar disks in galaxies 13 billion light-years from Earth — portraits of the Milky Way as a young galaxy."
Science,"NASA’s exoplanet count surges past 5,000
Thousands more candidate planets await confirmation
It’s official: The number of planets known beyond our solar system has just passed 5,000.
The exoplanet census surpassed this milestone with a recent batch of 60 confirmed exoplanets. These additional worlds were found in data from NASA’s now-defunct K2 mission, the “second life” of the prolific Kepler space telescope, and confirmed with new observations, researchers report March 4 at arXiv.org.
As of March 21, these finds put NASA’s official tally of exoplanets at 5,005.
It’s been 30 years since scientists discovered the first planets orbiting another star — an unlikely pair of small worlds huddled around a pulsar (SN: 1/11/92). Today, exoplanets are so common that astronomers expect most stars host at least one (SN: 1/11/12), says astronomer Aurora Kesseli of Caltech.
“One of the most exciting things that I think has happened in the last 30 years is that we’ve really started to be able to fill out the diversity of exoplanets,” Kesseli says
Some look like Jupiter, some look — perhaps — like Earth and some look like nothing familiar. The 5,005 confirmed exoplanets include nearly 1,500 giant gassy planets, roughly 200 that are small and rocky and almost 1,600 “super-Earths,” which are larger than our solar system’s rocky planets and smaller than Neptune (SN: 8/11/15).
Planet diversity
The 5,005 confirmed exoplanets can be categorized and divided into several distinct types, of which planets the size of Neptune are the most common. Super-Earths, not seen in our solar system, are a close second with Jupiter-like giant gassy planets coming in third. Small rocky worlds, some of which may resemble our own, come in fourth.
Astronomers can’t say much about those worlds beyond diameters, masses and densities. But several projects, like the James Webb Space Telescope, are working on that, Kesseli says (SN: 1/24/22). “Not only are we going to find tons and tons more exoplanets, but we’re also going to start to be able to actually characterize the planets,” she says.
And the search is far from over. NASA’s newest exoplanet hunter, the TESS mission, has confirmed more than 200 planets, with thousands more yet to verify, Kesseli says (SN: 12/2/21). Ongoing searches from ground-based telescopes keep adding to the count as well.
“There’s tons of exoplanets out there,” Kesseli says, “and even more waiting to be discovered.”"
Science,"The universe’s background starlight is twice as bright as expected
It took a spacecraft at the solar system’s edge to make precise enough observations of dark sky
Even when you remove the bright stars, the glowing dust and other nearby points of light from the inky, dark sky, a background glow remains. That glow comes from the cosmic sea of distant galaxies, the first stars that burned, faraway coalescing gas — and, it seems, something else in the mix that’s evading researchers.
Astronomers estimated the amount of visible light pervading the cosmos by training the New Horizons spacecraft, which flew past Pluto in 2015, on a spot on the sky mostly devoid of nearby stars and galaxies (SN: 12/15/15). That estimate should match measurements of the total amount of light coming from galaxies across the history of the universe. But it doesn’t, researchers report in the March 1 Astrophysical Journal Letters.
“It turns out that the galaxies that we know about can account for about half of the level we see,” says Tod Lauer, an astronomer at the National Science Foundation’s NOIRLab in Tucson, Ariz.
For decades, astronomers have measured the extragalactic background light in different wavelengths, from radio waves to gamma rays (SN: 8/23/13; SN: 11/29/18). This provides a census of the universe and gives researchers hints into the processes that emit those types of light.
But the background visible light — dubbed the cosmic optical background, or COB — is challenging to measure from the inner solar system. Here, lots of interplanetary dust scatters sunlight, washing out the much fainter COB. The Pluto-visiting New Horizons spacecraft, however, is far enough from the sun that scattered sunlight doesn’t flood the spacecraft’s images.
So in September 2021, Lauer and colleagues pointed the spacecraft’s LORRI camera toward a patch of sky and took a bunch of pictures. They digitally removed all known sources of light — individual stars, nearby galaxies, even heat from the spacecraft’s nuclear power source (SN: 2/18/16) — and measured what was left to estimate the COB.
Then they used large archives of galaxy observations, like those from the Hubble Space Telescope, to calculate the light emitted by all the galaxies in the universe. The measured COB is roughly twice as bright as that calculation.  
While Lauer’s group previously noted a discrepancy, this new measurement reveals a wider difference, and with smaller uncertainty. “There’s clearly an anomaly. Now we need to try to understand it and explain it,” says coauthor Marc Postman, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md.
There are several astronomical reasons that could explain the discrepancy. Perhaps, says Postman, rogue stars stripped from galaxies linger in intergalactic space. Or maybe, he says, there is “a very faint population of very compact galaxies that are just below the detection limits of Hubble.” If it’s the latter case, astronomers should know in the next couple years because NASA’s recently launched James Webb Space Telescope will see these even-fainter galaxies (SN: 10/6/21).
Another possibility is the researchers missed something in their analysis. “I’m glad it got done; it’s absolutely a necessary measurement,” says astrophysicist Michael Zemcov of the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York who was not involved in this study. Perhaps they’re missing some additional glow from the New Horizons spacecraft and its LORRI instrument, or they didn’t factor in some additional foreground light. “I think there’s a conversation there about details.”
The light that reflects off the Milky Way’s dust, for example, is “a very subtle beast,” Zemcov says, “and our uncertainties likely get dominated by it at some point, just because it’s not very well understood.”  Several projects in the next few years, such as the CIBER-2 experiment and the space mission SPHEREx, could help astronomers understand this pesky dust-scattered light,  Zemcov says.
In addition, he and his research group member, astrophysicist Teresa Symons, are poring through hundreds of old LORRI images of dark sky and running their own analyses. Meanwhile, Lauer and his colleagues will take more pictures of other patches of sky with LORRI to strengthen their confidence in the measurement of the background light and to better understand intrusions from the spacecraft itself.
“There is something going on that we weren’t expecting,” Zemcov says, “which is where the fun part of science kicks in.”

Science,"Levitating plastic beads mimic the physics of spinning asteroids
Whirling clumps of particles split up like space rocks falling to pieces
Some asteroids can barely hold it together.
Rather than solid lumps of rock, ‘rubble pile’ asteroids are loose collections of material, which can split apart as they rotate (SN: 3/16/20). To understand the inner workings of such asteroids, one team of scientists turned to levitating plastic beads. The beads clump together, forming collections that can spin and break up, physicist Melody Lim of the University of Chicago reported March 15 at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Chicago.
It’s an elegant dance that mimics the physics of asteroid formation, which happens too slowly to observe in real-life space rocks. “These ‘tabletop asteroids’ compress phenomena that take place over kilometers [and] over hundreds of thousands of years to just centimeters and seconds in the lab,” Lim said. The results are also reported in a paper accepted in Physical Review X.
Lim and colleagues used sound waves to levitate the plastic beads, which arranged themselves into two-dimensional clumps. Acoustic forces attract the beads to one another, mimicking the gravitational attraction between bits of debris in space. Separate clumps then coalesced similarly to how asteroids are thought to glom onto one another to grow.
When the experimenters gave the structures a spin using the sound waves, the clumps changed shape above a certain speed, becoming elongated. That could help scientists understand why ‘rubble pile’ asteroids, can have odd structures, such as the ‘spinning tops’ formed by asteroids Bennu and Ryugu (SN: 12/18/18).
Eventually, the fast-spinning clumps broke apart. This observation could help explain why asteroids are typically seen to spin up to a certain rate, but not beyond: Speed demons get split up."
Science,"Physicists explain the mesmerizing movements of raindrops on car windshields
Competing forces of wind and gravity push some droplets up while pulling others down
Staring at raindrops on a car windshield is more than just a way to get in touch with your emo side. You might also learn some physics.
As a car speeds along in the rain, some water droplets slide up the windshield, others slide down, and some seem stuck in place. “It’s very hypnotizing, isn’t it?” says fluid mechanics researcher Sungyon Lee of the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.
Lee and Alireza Hooshanginejad, a fluid mechanics researcher at Cornell University, used mathematical equations to describe the forces on the raindrops. That work revealed several factors that determine a droplet’s behavior, the pair reports March 4 in Physical Review Fluids.
Raindrops on a moving car’s angled windshield simultaneously experience forces from gravity and from the wind that speeds over the car. The direction that a raindrop moves depends on its size, Lee and Hooshanginejad say.
For larger raindrops, gravity wins, pulling the droplets down. For smaller raindrops, wind prevails, pushing them up the slope. For medium-sized raindrops, the forces balance out and the droplets sit still. The tiniest raindrops also stay put, because the wind doesn’t provide enough oomph to overcome water’s tendency to adhere to the glass.
Other factors affect the raindrops’ behavior, too. As the car’s speed, and therefore wind speed, increases, larger raindrops get pushed up the windshield. Decreasing the car’s speed has the opposite effect. And if the car moves slowly enough, there won’t be enough wind to coax any raindrops to move upward. Meanwhile, windshields that are more steeply angled allow smaller raindrops to succumb to gravity than shallower windshields do, the results suggest.
To simplify the calculations, the researchers studied an idealized version of raindrops, based on only two dimensions. That means that the results won’t translate perfectly to real-world raindrops, Lee says, but can still give a sense of why water droplets do what they do."
Science,"Russia’s war in Ukraine raises nuclear risks, physicists warn
Experts flag the potential for accidents at seized sites and dangers of an unintended nuclear war
Russia’s war with Ukraine is heightening nuclear fears on two fronts. Attacks on nuclear facilities have raised concerns about accidents, and threats from Russian President Vladimir Putin have amped up worries over the potential for nuclear warfare.
Physicists historically have played a role in creating these technologies, and in keeping humankind safe from the dangers posed by them. Here’s what two key physicists have to say about the nuclear issues raised by the war in Ukraine.
Nuclear power
On March 4, Russian forces shelled Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, causing a fire in one of the site’s buildings. The largest nuclear plant in Europe, it normally provides more than 20 percent of Ukraine’s power. Radiation levels have remained normal, according to the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine. But the danger to Ukraine’s nuclear power plants is not over, Edwin Lyman of the Union of Concerned Scientists said in a March 4 news briefing.
“These plants are now in a situation that few people ever seriously contemplated when they were originally built, and that is the potential that they would be in the middle of a war zone,” said Lyman, a physicist by training. “No nuclear plant has been designed to withstand the potential threat of a full-scale military attack, and the plants in Ukraine are no exception.”
Nuclear zones
Ukraine has four active nuclear power plants — Zaporizhzhya, Rivno, Khmelnitsky and South Ukraine — and an additional nuclear facility at Chernobyl, the site of a 1986 accident that contaminated the area.
The Zaporizhzhya plant in southern Ukraine is now under Russian control. Ukraine informed the International Atomic Energy Agency that Russian forces are requiring approval for any actions taken by the plant management, the agency reported in a March 6 statement. Additionally, Russian forces have cut off internet access and certain other connections with the outside world, making communication with the site’s operators difficult, the statement said.
If workers’ access to the site is restricted, that could jeopardize the safety of the plant in various ways, Lyman warned. “It’s important to recognize that even if a nuclear reactor is shut down … that core still requires cooling to prevent dangerous overheating of the fuel that could lead to fuel damage and potential radiological release.”
To ensure safety, workers must be able to apply any emergency measures needed to maintain cooling. In 2011, in the aftermath of an earthquake and tsunami, reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in Japan endured explosions, melting of reactor cores and the release of radioactive material when a loss of power prevented workers from maintaining cooling (SN: 3/14/11).
What’s more, if the Zaporizhzhya plant’s operators are not allowed to freely come and go, “the personnel on-site might not have the opportunity to be relieved of their duties and this could lead, obviously, to fatigue compounded by the stress of working under duress,” Lyman said. Under such conditions, operators might be more likely to make mistakes, creating a situation ripe for dangerous nuclear accidents.
Lyman raised similar concerns over worker fatigue at the site of the 1986 Chernobyl accident in Ukraine (SN: 5/3/86). On February 24, Russian forces occupied that site, which still demands a crew of workers to maintain and monitor it to prevent any further nuclear incidents. On March 7, Ukraine’s nuclear regulator reported that workers had been on-site for 12 days without a staff rotation.
Russian forces also shelled a nuclear facility at the Kharkiv Institute of Physics and Technology, a source of neutrons used for research, the nuclear regulator reported March 6. The radiation levels at the site are normal, the regulator said March 7.
Overall, around half of Ukraine’s electricity comes from nuclear energy: The country has four active nuclear power plants, comprising 15 nuclear reactors. As of March 7, Russian forces appeared to be approaching another nuclear plant, the South Ukraine nuclear power plant, in Yuzhnoukrains’k, CNN reported March 4. “The Ukrainian authorities have called for the establishment of what they call ‘safe zones’ around each nuclear power plant,” Lyman said. The issues faced by the nuclear sites “demonstrate how important that is.”
Nuclear warfare
While the danger of a nuclear accident is alarming enough on its own, the threat of nuclear weapons is adding to the worries.
The global unease was almost palpable after Vladimir Putin declared February 27 that he had ordered Russia’s nuclear forces to a state of high alert or “special combat readiness.” Nuclear threats are not to be taken lightly, especially those involving Russia and the United States, which together host the vast majority of the world’s nuclear weapons.
But, says physicist Frank von Hippel, an emeritus professor of public and international affairs at Princeton University, the finger was already on the trigger even before Putin’s declaration.
Russia and the United States each have several hundred nuclear warheads in what’s called a “launch-on-warning” posture, in which a retaliatory barrage of nuclear missiles can be launched as soon as warning systems detect an enemy launch. You don’t get higher alert than that,” von Hippel says. “That’s routine, day-to-day, irrespective of international events.”
While it’s not clear exactly what Russia’s “special combat readiness” means in practice, von Hippel says that the country could ready additional weapons — for example by getting bombers loaded up at the end of runways. But the hair-trigger capacity for widespread nuclear destruction is already present.
Still, nuclear provocations like Putin’s matter, von Hippel says. “It does increase the danger of accidental nuclear war.” If an early-warning system misidentifies a nuclear attack, responders could initiate nuclear annihilation based on a misunderstanding. And in light of Russia’s heightened nuclear status, the response in the United States to a warning might be less skeptical. “The ground might already have been prepared psychologically … to expect that this is actually the real thing.”
In the 1980s, when nuclear arsenals were at their peak, the United States and the former Soviet Union together had about 70,000 warheads. Now, the entire world’s cache is closer to 10,000. But the numbers have stopped going down, says von Hippel, “and 10,000 is still enough to destroy civilization and cause billions of deaths.”
With the help of the American Physical Society, von Hippel and others formed the Physicists Coalition for Nuclear Threat Reduction, a group that includes around 650 physicists. The researchers lobby the U.S. Congress for changes in nuclear policy, for example, arguing for a “no-first-use” policy that would declare that U.S. nuclear weapons would be used only in response to another nuclear attack.
“The nuclear weapons era has just gone on too long,” von Hippel says. “We’ve been very lucky that there hasn’t been a nuclear war, but we can’t keep depending on luck given the consequences of all the destructive power that we’ve built up.”"
Science,"What do we mean by ‘COVID-19 changes your brain’?
A study linked SARS-CoV-2 infections with smaller brain regions, but the implications are unclear
Like all writers, I spend large chunks of my time looking for words. When it comes to the ultracomplicated and mysterious brain, I need words that capture nuance and uncertainties. The right words confront and address hard questions about exactly what new scientific findings mean, and just as importantly, why they matter.
The search for the right words is on my mind because of recent research on COVID-19 and the brain. As part of a large brain-scanning study, researchers found that infections of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, were linked with less gray matter, tissue that’s packed with the bodies of brain cells.
The results, published March 7 in Nature, prompted headlines about COVID-19 causing brain damage and shrinkage. That coverage, in turn, prompted alarmed posts on social media, including mentions of early-onset dementia and brain rotting.
As someone who has reported on brain research for more than a decade, I can say those alarming words are not the ones that I would choose here.
The study is one of the first to look at structural changes in the brain before and after a SARS-CoV-2 infection. And the study is meticulous. It was done by an expert group of brain imaging researchers who have been doing this sort of research for a very long time. As part of the UK Biobank project, 785 participants underwent two MRI scans. Between those scans, 401 people had COVID-19 and 384 people did not. By comparing the before and after scans, researchers could spot changes in the people who had COVID-19 and compare those changes with people who didn’t get the infection.
After a bout of COVID-19, people had, on average, less gray matter in parts of the brain that help handle the sense of smell. That’s an interesting finding, especially given the virus’s ability to steal people’s sense of smell, and one that’s definitely worth a whole lot more research (SN: 1/17/22). But it’s also not surprising, given what we know about the brain’s propensity to change.
I can rattle off a long, long list of things that change the brain, such as learning new things, sleeping and using a smartphone (SN: 9/5/17; SN: 6/5/14; SN 3/17/17). Learning the streets of London, juggling and meditating may all change the structure of the brain. Essentially, the events of our lives are reflected in the size, shape and behavior of our constantly changing brains. 
Growing up is one of those events that changed your brain. As a toddler, you had the most nerve cell connections in some parts of your brain that you’ll ever have in your life. Those overabundant connections were then pruned and refined. In early adolescence, some parts of your brain were the largest they will be, by volume. Over your teenage years, parts of your brain got smaller, a trend that continues as you grow older (SN: 10/14/15). Changes continue as you age (SN: 7/13/16). 
“The brain is dynamic,” says neuroscientist Emily Jacobs of the University of California, Santa Barbara. “Less doesn’t mean worse, necessarily, and more doesn’t mean better.”
For instance, Jacobs and her colleagues have found that brain areas grow and shrink over the course of days, changes that are tethered to hormone levels across the menstrual cycle. This change, found in the hippocampus, a brain structure tied to learning and memory, and nearby areas, “belies the notion that the brain is static,” Jacobs says. “Instead, we can see these ebbs and flows of changes.”
Pregnancy, and its ensuing hormone shifts, can also change the brain. In 2016, I covered a study that described pregnancy-related reductions in gray matter (SN: 12/19/16). That story raised the same sticky question as the recent COVID-19 brain study about the right words to describe this brain change. In the pregnancy and brain study, were the changes shrinkage or damage? Or to cast it in a more positive light, was it maturing or sculpting? Study coauthor Elseline Hoekzema, a neuroscientist at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told me back then that to her, the process seemed like a second stage of brain maturing, akin to the refinements that happen during adolescence.
Jacobs also works on menopause, another big hormonal shift that affects the brain. And she has preliminary evidence that men’s brains change day-to-day, too. Like me, Jacobs also grapples with language when describing some of these changes. Words matter, quite a bit, she says. “You can paint [research findings] as a good thing or as a horror story.” 
So which scenario best captures the new COVID-19 results? It’s probably safe to assume that a viral infection isn’t a good thing. But is it bad for the brain, and if so, how bad? The answer, frustrating though it may be, is that we don’t yet know. “We were quite surprised to see clear differences in the brain, even with mild infection,” says Gwenaëlle Douaud, of the Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences at the University of Oxford. “The concern is that these damages will last and make infected people more vulnerable to brain diseases in the future.”
But these differences may not last, Douaud says. The brain can “reorganize and heal itself to some extent, even in older people,” she notes. It’s also possible that the changes the team sees are due to a lack of smell input. Other research has shown that stuffy noses can lead to brain changes, too, some of which are similar to those that the researchers found in the recent brain-scanning study. Perhaps these brain changes would reverse when the sense of smell returns.
Scanning the recent brain study participants again in a few years will help clear up the question of permanence. But for now, there is no way we can say with any certainty whether these brain changes will linger — and what they mean for a healthy brain. “We haven’t distinguished between what are normal changes and what are not,” Jacobs says.
Until scientists figure out more about the brain, including what brain changes are normal, reversible or inconsequential, we can’t possibly know what’s worrisome. So for now, the right words remain elusive."
Science,"A gene therapy for hemophilia boosts levels of a crucial clotting protein
It’s not yet clear how long the effects of the one-time treatment for the blood disorder last
A gene-based therapy is potentially a step closer to becoming a one-time treatment for men with hemophilia. The life-threatening genetic disorder hinders the body’s ability to form blood clots.
In hemophilia A, the most common type, the gene responsible for a blood clotting protein called factor VIII has errors, leading the body to produce an insufficient amount of the protein. A new study describes how 132 men with a severe form of the disease who received one infusion of the gene therapy fared. A year later, 88 percent of them had factor VIII levels high enough to have either a mild form or no disease, researchers report March 16 in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Hemophilia A is an inherited disorder. The gene that provides instructions for making factor VIII is found on the X chromosome, so the condition more typically affects males than females. In the United States, there are 12 hemophilia A cases per 100,000 males.
The severity of hemophilia is classified by the amount of factor VIII that the body manages to produce. People with mild disease, who have 5 to 40 percent of typical factor VIII levels, are most likely to have excessive bleeding only after injury or surgery. Moderate hemophilia, with levels 1 to 5 percent of the usual amount, can also include bleeding that occurs spontaneously, without a clear cause. People with severe hemophilia have next to no factor VIII and, without treatment, face frequent, spur-of-the-moment bleeding internally that can damage their joints or brain.
But thanks to the treatment options available, hemophilia patients “now have a normal life expectancy and are encouraged to live normal lives,” says director of the Washington Center for Bleeding Disorders and hematologist Rebecca Kruse-Jarres of the University of Washington in Seattle, who was not involved in the gene therapy study.
The standard treatment to prevent bleeding is a replacement infusion of factor VIII, which is needed every 2 to 3 days. That means a person with hemophilia A could face more than 150 of these treatments a year. More recently, a monoclonal antibody that mimics the action of factor VIII has become available, giving adults and children with the disease a once-weekly treatment option.
The gene therapy, called valoctocogene roxaparvovec, consists of a one-time infusion containing genetic instructions for producing factor VIII, delivered by an adeno-associated virus, which does not cause disease (SN: 10/28/02). The virus is taken up by many different cells, but only liver cells can use the instructions to make the clotting protein.
While most of the study participants saw an improvement in their factor VIII levels, the therapy did not work for a small percentage. And most participants also experienced a concerning side effect — elevated levels of a liver enzyme that can be sign of inflammation or potential damage to the organ, which required treatment with immunosuppressants.
It’s also unclear how long the effects of the treatment will last. The researchers report that in 17 participants followed for two years, the clotting protein levels achieved in the first year decreased in the second year. The gene therapy can only be given once because a person would have an immune response to a second dose. More research is needed to understand the long-term durability of the treatment and the best way to manage the increased liver enzyme levels, says study coauthor and hematologist Margareth Ozelo of the University of Campinas in São Paulo.
“This will be not a treatment for all patients,” Ozelo says, but “will benefit a group of patients in the hemophilia community.” With more work, it may be possible to determine which patients are more likely to respond well to the gene therapy, she says.
Gene therapy could be a wonderful option, because it would almost eliminate the burden of treatments, says Kruse-Jarres. But when considering gene therapy, “a lot of unknowns come into play,” she says."
Science,"School mask mandates in the U.S. reduced coronavirus transmission
Mandatory masking lowered transmission of the delta variant by 72 percent
The verdict is, once again, in: Masking in schools is effective.
During the COVID-19 pandemic’s delta variant wave, schools that required masking had approximately one-fourth the rates of in-school coronavirus transmission than schools with optional or partial masking policies, researchers report online March 9 in Pediatrics.
While the findings reinforce past research on masking efficacy, this is the first study to focus on secondary transmissions, or transmissions that happen at school, and how the rate is impacted by vaccination, community spread and district size, says study coauthor Danny Benjamin, an epidemiologist at Duke University. The team found that schools play a small role in terms of transmission in a community, accounting for less than 10 percent of total cases in the study. But masks are what help keep that number low.
To conduct a wide-reaching study, the researchers reached out to every kindergarten through 12th grade public school district in the United States — more than 13,800 of them — to track their case numbers and origins from July to December 2021. The 61 districts that answered the call consisted of more than 1 million students and nearly 160,000 staff across nine states.
Now that vaccines are available for kids ages 5 to 11, the researchers are collecting more data from schools. Masking has continued to work during the omicron variant surge, but even short intervals of mask removal, such as at lunchtime, result in much higher transmission than during the delta wave, Benjamin says.
As state mask mandates lift, the onus for mask requirements in schools falls to the school districts. To help school administrators decide if and when students need to mask, Benjamin and colleagues developed the Masking and Mitigation Considerations Calculator. The tool allows administrators to input their community COVID-19 rates and determine how masking decisions in schools will affect case numbers.
“This is a very granular and local and nuanced decision,” Benjamin says. Right now, as the omicron surge recedes in some parts of the country, “it’s a reasonable discussion to be having.”"
Science,"How climbers help scientists vibe with Utah’s famous red rock formations
The work provides new insights on the geologic structures’ seismic stability
As Kathryn Vollinger prepared to climb Castleton Tower, a 120-meter-tall sandstone formation in the desert near Moab, Utah, the outdoor guide assessed her gear. Ropes? Check. Helmet and harnesses? Check. Climbing rack? Check. That day in March 2018, Vollinger’s checklist also included an unusual piece of equipment: a seismometer. The excursion wasn’t solely for pleasure; it was also for science. 
Castleton Tower and its peers may appear still. But these soaring geologic structures are in constant motion, vibrating in response to earthquakes, human activity and even distant ocean waves. The same goes for fins, rock formations that are irregularly shaped instead of cylindrical or rectangular like towers, says geophysicist Riley Finnegan of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.
The seismometers measure how much the towers and fins naturally vibrate. Those data are key to assessing the formations’ stability and could even help researchers search the rocks for possible signs of seismic activity in the distant past (SN: 3/15/06).
Such insights are important not just to scientists, but also to Native Americans, including the Eastern Shoshone, Hopi, Navajo, Southern Paiute, Ute and Zuni peoples. Many of the landforms, which are located on the traditional lands of these groups, hold cultural and religious significance, Finnegan says.
Finnegan’s team has been working with Vollinger for nearly five years to assemble the first dataset on the dynamic physical properties of 14 towers and fins, which the researchers published February 16 in Seismological Research Letters. Without experienced climbers like Vollinger on board, the project wouldn’t have been possible, Finnegan says.
Collecting the data was a tremendous challenge. Safely scaling the trickiest formations requires climbing chops, strength, endurance and a sizeable dose of planning. “There’s only so much risk I’m willing to take for getting those seismometers up,” Vollinger says. “When you’re hauling extra gear, that adds another element to it.”
Vollinger and her climbing partner, husband Nathan Richman, had to ensure that the rock faces were vertical enough to avoid dragging the equipment. Dragging would “likely knock loose rock off,” she says. Once Vollinger reached the top of a formation — after anywhere from one to six hours of climbing — she read books or chatted with her husband while a seismometer collected data. They then hauled the instrument and their other gear back down.
Back at the University of Utah, Finnegan and colleagues analyzed the data, finding that the structures’ lowest natural frequencies — called fundamental frequencies — range from 0.8 to 15 hertz. In other words, the towers sway roughly one to 15 times per second.
The team also used computer models to study the ways in which the formations bend and twist at a given frequency. Those simulations helped provide a more complete picture of how physics influences the behavior of towers and fins, Finnegan says.
What’s more, inputting the height, density, cross-sectional area and other material properties of the formations into the model predicted the formations’ fundamental frequencies.
The findings “strengthen our understanding of the dependence on height and width for the [fundamental frequencies] of these features,” says Ramon Arrowsmith, a geologist at Arizona State University in Tempe who wasn’t involved with the work. Finnegan and her colleagues have proven that “the geometry is sufficient to really talk about the dominant frequencies for the behavior of the pillars.”
Eventually, such a model could eliminate the need for climbers to deploy seismometers to measure frequency. And should future scientists require seismic measurements, Arrowsmith envisions robots putting seismometers in place and drones flying by to collect data later. But for now, Vollinger will continue scaling these formations for science."
Science,"The mysterious Hiawatha crater in Greenland is 58 million years old
The impact that carved the crater is too old to have caused the Younger Dryas cold snap
The powerful impact that created a mysterious crater at the northwestern edge of Greenland’s ice sheet happened about 58 million years ago, researchers report March 9 in Science Advances.
That timing, confirmed by two separate dating methods, means that the asteroid or comet or meteorite that carved the depression struck long before the Younger Dryas cold snap about 13,000 years ago. Some researchers have suggested the cold spell was caused by such an impact.
Scientists spotted the crater in 2015 during a scan by NASA’s Operation IceBridge, which used airborne radar to measure the ice sheet’s thickness. Those and other data revealed that the crater, dubbed Hiawatha, is a round depression that spans 31 kilometers and is buried beneath a kilometer of ice (SN: 11/14/18).
The next step was to determine how old the Hiawatha crater might be. Though the depression itself is unreachable, meltwater at the ice’s base had ported out pebbles and other sediments bearing telltale signs of alteration by an impact, including sand from partially melted rocks and pebbles containing intensely deformed, or “shocked,” zircon crystals.
Geochemist Gavin Kenny of the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm and colleagues dated these alterations using two methods based on the radioactive decay of isotopes, or different forms of elements. For the zircons, the team measured the decay of uranium to lead, and in the sand, the researchers compared the abundances of radioactive argon isotopes with stable ones. Both methods suggest that the impact occurred about 57.99 million years ago.
That makes the crater far too old to be the smoking gun long sought by proponents of the controversial Younger Dryas impact hypothesis (SN: 6/26/18). The timing also isn’t quite right to link it to a warm period called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, which began around 56 million years ago (SN: 9/28/16). For now, the researchers say, what impact this space punch may have had on Earth’s global climate remains a mystery."
Science,"Weird ‘superionic’ matter could make up Earth’s inner core
Material that’s a mash-up of solid and liquid could explain oddities of the planet’s center
A quirky material that behaves like a mishmash of liquid and solid could be hidden deep in the Earth.
Computer simulations described in two studies suggest that the material in Earth’s inner core, which includes iron and other, lighter elements, may be in a “superionic” state. That means that while the iron stays put, as in a solid, the lighter elements flow like a liquid.
The research gives a potential peek at the inner workings of an enigmatic, inaccessible realm of the planet. According to conventional scientific wisdom, Earth’s core consists of a liquid outer core surrounding a solid inner core (SN: 1/28/19). But beyond knowing that the inner core is rich in iron, scientists don’t know exactly which other elements are present, and in what quantities.
“The inner core is very difficult to scrutinize simply because it’s so deep beneath our feet,” says geophysicist Hrvoje Tkalčić of Australian National University in Canberra.
Seismic waves stirred up by earthquakes can plow through the inner core, providing clues to what’s inside. But measurements of these waves have left researchers puzzled. The velocity of one type of wave, called a shear wave, is lower than expected for solid iron or for many types of iron alloys — mixtures of iron with other materials. “That is a mystery about the inner core,” says geophysicist Yu He of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Guiyang.
In one new study, He and colleagues simulated a group of 64 iron atoms, along with various types of lighter elements — hydrogen, carbon and oxygen — under pressures and temperatures expected for the inner core. In a normal solid, atoms arrange themselves in an orderly grid, holding fast to their positions. In a superionic material, some of the atoms arrange neatly, as in a solid, while others are liquid-like free spirits that slip right through the solid lattice. In the simulation, the researchers found, the lighter elements moved about while the iron stayed in place.
That superionic status slowed shear waves, the researchers report February 9 in Nature, suggesting the weird phase of matter could explain the unexpected shear wave velocity measured in the inner core.
Shear waves, also known as secondary or S waves, jiggle the Earth perpendicular to their direction of travel, like the undulations that move along a jump rope that’s wiggled up and down (SNS: 1/12/18). Other waves, called primary or P waves, compress and expand the Earth in a direction parallel to their travel, like an accordion being squeezed.
To really explain the inner core, scientists must find a combination of elements that keeps with everything scientists know about the inner core, including its S wave velocity, P wave velocity and its density. “You have to match all three things, otherwise it doesn’t work,” says mineral physicist John Brodholt of University College London.
In a study published in August 2021 in Earth and Planetary Science Letters, Brodholt and colleagues did just that. A simulation of iron, silicon and hydrogen atoms reproduced the inner core’s known characteristics. In the simulation, the material was also superionic: The iron and silicon stayed in position while the hydrogen flowed like a liquid.
But Brodholt notes that their result is just one possible explanation for the inner core’s properties. Brodholt and his colleagues have previously found other combinations of elements that could explain the inner core without going superionic, he says, leaving unresolved the question of what lurks in Earth’s deepest depths.
Another puzzle of Earth’s heart is the fact that the inner core’s structure seems to change over time. This has previously been interpreted as evidence that the inner core rotates at a different rate than the rest of the Earth. But He and colleagues suggest that it could instead result from the motions of liquid-like light elements swirling inside the inner core and changing the distribution of elements over time. “This paper sort of offers an explanation for both of these phenomena” — the slow shear wave velocity and the shifting structure — says Tkalčić, who was not involved with either new study.
One thing missing is laboratory experiments showing how these combinations of elements behave under inner core conditions, says geophysicist Daniele Antonangeli of Sorbonne University in Paris, who was not involved with the new research. Such tests could help confirm whether the simulations are correct.
Previous experiments have found evidence that water ice can go superionic, perhaps under conditions found inside Uranus or Neptune (SN: 2/5/18). But researchers can’t yet probe the behavior of superionic materials under the conditions thought to exist inside Earth’s core. So scientists will have to keep pushing the tests to further extremes, Antonangeli says. “The experimentalist that is within me craves seeing experimental validation of this.”"
Science,"The Alps’ Matterhorn shows how much even big mountains sway
Such data can help planners map high-risk zones for peaks, bridges or any large structures
With its dramatic pyramid-like shape, the Matterhorn is said to be the most photographed peak in the Swiss Alps. Its steep slopes also make it notoriously hard to climb. What’s not visible to photographers or climbers is another important trait of this mountain: It is always subtly swaying. New data show that it shimmies in all directions.
Those motions will vary by site and triggering conditions. The Matterhorn’s sway continues day in and day out. Indeed, the study found “no measurable seasonal variations” due to such things as temperature changes or snow and ice accumulation.
That it moves was not a surprise, says Bob Anderson. He’s a geologist at the University of Colorado Boulder. “Amazingly,” he says, “Earth — practically anywhere we measure it — is in motion.”
Yet the study did unearth new things. The top of the Matterhorn sways more than its base — 14 times more. At the peak’s summit, each sway lasts roughly two and half seconds.
Gauging how much mountains — or any massive structures — move was the goal here, says Jeff Moore. He’s a geoscientist at the University of Utah. That’s in Salt Lake City. “We really wanted to bring this mountain alive for people,” he says, showing how it’s “constantly quivering.”
Those motions are a response to what’s happening in and around it.
“Earth is constantly humming with seismic energy,” Moore explains. These seismic waves are “created by near and far-off earthquakes.” A bigger surprise, Moore says, was finding that the Matterhorn is kind of in tune with the world’s oceans. “It’s really a strange connection,” he says, “and one that we didn’t anticipate.”
Big ocean waves produce strong seismic energy, he says. As those waves meet and cross, they set up “a kind of pumping on the seafloor that’s measured all over the world, all the time” — including at the Matterhorn. He says this means there’s a vibrational connection between the world’s oceans and this mountain.
Recognizing the movements of such huge structures is not just a curiosity. Knowing the typical sway — and how it might vary under different triggers — could help nearby communities understand their risk of landslides.
Moore was part of an international team that shared these new findings in the January 2022 Earth and Planetary Science Letters
Taking the Matterhorn’s pulse
One could think of a mountain as a bell that vibrates in response to triggering movements. And mountains are not alone. All hard structures — including office buildings, statues and cars — can vibrate like bells. (Perhaps you’ve felt the subtle motion as your home shudders and windows rattle when a big truck rumbles down the street.) Many things can set hard structures shaking. Most obvious are explosions or earthquakes. But truck and train traffic can, too.
In most cases, the swaying of mountains is so subtle that only super sensitive devices can detect it. Called seismometers, three such devices were installed to measure the Matterhorn’s shimmying. Team member Samuel Weber placed one at the mountain’s peak. That was 4,478 meters (14,692 feet) above sea level. A second went at the base. Another was placed in between those two, on a ridge. Weber works at the federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in Davos Dorf, Switzerland.
Typically, the new data show, the mountain top may sway only tiny amounts, “like micrometers, or even nanometers,” says Moore. “But if an earthquake passes through, it will move millimeters — and more if it’s a big earthquake.”
Knowing how much more the mountain can move under various conditions will help improve maps identifying landslides and other seismic hazards. Anderson, at Colorado, says, “I can imagine that this kind of information would help us address how likely it is that a landslide occurs at different parts of different mountains.”
Moore says his team focused on the Matterhorn “because it’s so well-known and culturally prominent.” But they also made similar measurements at another Swiss peak, Grosse Mythen. Its shape is similar to the Matterhorn’s.
This far smaller mountain vibrates at a frequency around four times higher than the Matterhorn’s. Smaller objects generally vibrate at higher frequencies, Moore notes. These mountain sways, he says, are likely “representative of a phenomenon happening to some degree at all mountains.”
Such data may offer lessons for buildings and other structures, notes Kris Pankow. She’s a seismologist at the University of Utah who did not take part in the new study. For instance, they might be useful in deciding what type of buildings to construct where, both at mountainous sites and at sea level."
Science,"Let’s learn about Earth’s secret stash of underground water
Groundwater, though largely hidden from view, is the most abundant source of freshwater on the planet
Walking over water might sound like a miracle. In fact, people do it all the time. How? Almost all of the world’s liquid freshwater lies underground. This stash beneath our feet is called groundwater.
Earth is a water planet, but most of its H2O is in the oceans. Only about 2.5 percent of the planet’s water is freshwater. Of that, nearly 69 percent is frozen in glaciers and ice caps. About 30 percent is groundwater — much more than the meager 1.2 percent that flows through rivers and fills lakes.
Groundwater is found almost everywhere on Earth. It lurks under mountains, plains and even deserts. Tiny gaps between rocks and soil grains soak up and hold this water like a sponge, forming buried bodies of water called aquifers. Together, they hold about 60 times as much water as the world’s lakes and rivers combined.
Groundwater is a key part of Earth’s water cycle. Rain and melted snow seep down into the ground. There, the water can stay for thousands of years. Some groundwater naturally leaks out onto Earth’s surface through springs. It also feeds into lakes, rivers and wetlands. People extract groundwater through wells for drinking, sanitation, watering crops and other uses.
In fact, people extract more than 200 times as much groundwater from Earth as oil every year. Most groundwater is used to water crops. But this water also quenches the thirst of some 2 billion people worldwide, including half the population of the United States.
As human-caused climate change dries out parts of the planet, demand for groundwater may rise. At the same time, climate change may intensify storms. Heavier rains are more likely to rush straight into streams and storm drains than soak into soil. So, there may be less groundwater to go around.
Many of the world’s aquifers already seem to be drying up. Twenty-one of Earth’s 37 biggest aquifers are shrinking, satellite data show. The most dried-out aquifers are near big cities, farms or arid regions. As groundwater stores dwindle, they hold less water to refill rivers and streams, threatening freshwater ecosystems. In California, sucking the ground dry may even be triggering small earthquakes.
Meanwhile, human activity pollutes groundwater in many places. Arsenic from farming or mining seeps into aquifers. So do chemicals that are injected underground to flush out oil or gas in a process called fracking. Electronic waste from discarded devices and sewage have also tainted groundwater. What can be done? Cutting back on pollution and finding new ways to purify groundwater may help protect this precious resource.
Want to know more? We’ve got some stories to get you started:
Groundwater pumping is draining rivers and streams worldwide Over half of pumped watersheds could pass a serious type of limit by 2050. (11/6/2019) Readability: 7.4
Many of Earth’s groundwater basins are drying out The majority of the world’s largest aquifers are quickly being drained. (6/30/2015) Readability: 8.1
A wave of change is coming to our planet’s water resources Thanks to climate change, Earth’s freshwater supplies will never be the same again. (12/6/2018) Readability: 7.7"
Science,"Scientists Say: Richter Scale
The Richter scale and other magnitude scales measure how strong earthquakes are
The Richter scale is a measure of earthquake magnitude. That is, the strength of an earthquake. The bigger the quake, the bigger its magnitude on the Richter scale.
Seismologists Charles Richter and Beno Gutenberg came up with this scale in the 1930s. They rated earthquake magnitude based on the biggest ground vibration — or seismic wave — measured from a quake. The scale was logarithmic (Log-uh-RITH-mik). That means each step up on the Richter scale represents 10 times stronger ground shaking. Earthquakes of about magnitude 3 are just strong enough to be felt. Magnitude 4 and 5 earthquakes are often bad enough to cause damage. The most severe earthquakes ever recorded have been about magnitude 9.
The Richter scale works well for sizing up small earthquakes. But it tends to underestimate big quakes. So, the Richter scale is rarely used today. Instead, scientists use the moment magnitude scale. This is another logarithmic scale for earthquake magnitude. This system uses newer technology to analyze seismic waves in much more detail than Richter’s method. Those details offer a better estimate of the total energy an earthquake releases — and therefore a more accurate earthquake magnitude."
Science,"Explainer: Telescopes see light — and sometimes ancient history
What they detect depends upon the wavelengths to which their ‘eyes’ are sensitive
When you look up at the night sky, how many stars can you see? In a big city, you can probably see the moon and just a handful of bright stars. On a cloudless night in a small town or out in the country, you may see thousands of stars. Have you ever looked through a telescope to see these celestial objects even more clearly?
A telescope uses lenses, mirrors or both to focus incoming light from very far away sources. A backyard telescope can easily see craters on the moon or the rings around Saturn. Larger telescopes can show Jupiter’s bands of clouds. Far bigger instruments can peer much, much deeper into the heavens. But how?
It might seem like a telescope is just a big magnifying glass. But there’s more to it than that. A telescope also collects additional light that’s too faint to be seen. You can think of this like setting a bucket outside during a rainstorm. Just as a bigger bucket will collect more raindrops, a bigger telescope will collect more light. Since most objects in space are very far away, their light is extremely dim by the time it reaches Earth. Telescopes help by gathering more light than the unaided eye could ever see.
Very large telescopes are often housed in observatories. Some observatories house multiple telescopes. These buildings are dome-shaped and painted white or silver to reflect sunlight. This keeps the building as cool as possible. The dome protects the instrument from wind, dust and precipitation. Each dome has a large door that rolls open so the telescope can peer out. Both the dome and its telescope rotate so that all parts of the night sky can be observed.
It makes sense to build large telescopes away from cities and their light pollution. It also helps to build telescopes high up, such as on mountaintops. That limits how much Earth’s atmosphere can blur the telescope’s views of space.
For a telescope, peering up through the atmosphere is like looking toward the surface of a swimming pool when you’re underwater. Everything looks blurry and wavy, even when the water is still and clear. The lowest layer of Earth’s atmosphere — the troposphere — is to blame. Heat causes ripples in the air. That blurs light from stars, galaxies and planets. Water vapor also smears the light. Dust and pollution cloud the air. City lights also reflect off of molecules in the air, making it harder to see dim stars. Getting above as much of the atmosphere and pollution as possible reduces those effects.
Some telescopes use glass lenses to focus light from space. These are called refracting telescopes. Many other telescopes, known as reflectors, focus light with curved mirrors.
Even when looking through telescopes, however, our eyes are not very good at seeing extremely faint light. Astronomers started using photographic film to capture light from such faint objects more than a century ago. By exposing a telescope to faint light from space for a very long time, it’s possible to collect enough light to show up on film. Now, telescopes are equipped with devices called photomultipliers. If you think back to the example of putting a bucket outside during a rainstorm, these photomultipliers are like buckets that are so sensitive they can capture — and record — a single raindrop in a light drizzle.
When telescopes look at more distant objects, they are also looking farther back in time. The reason: The light that telescopes collect has taken a long time to get here. The farther away a light-emitting object is, the longer the light’s journey to Earth. In some cases, it took billions of years. So the image seen through a telescope now actually reveals how an object looked long ago, when the light was first emitted. In some cases, the source of that light may now be long gone.
Over the last few decades, astronomers have begun sending telescopes into space aboard orbiting spacecraft. That way, there’s no atmosphere to worry about at all. The Hubble Space Telescope is probably the most famous of these space-based telescopes. Launched in 1990, it’s still working today. Hubble collects many of the same wavelengths of light that our eyes can see. This range covers the rainbow, from longer, red wavelengths of light to shorter, violet wavelengths of light.
And there are many more wavelengths of light than what our eyes perceive. Some telescopes focus on these other parts of the light spectrum. In general, imperfections in the smoothness of a telescope’s observing surface need to be smaller than the wavelength it’s trying to detect. Since we can’t see these wavelengths, computer programs color-code telescope images to depict what the telescope sees in ways we can understand. Shorter wavelengths might be depicted in purple, for instance, and longer wavelengths shown in red. Each invisible wavelength that’s detected is assigned a color we can see. The resulting image looks like the real object, just in a “false” or shifted color.
Gathering light longer than the eye can see
Infrared telescopes image wavelengths that are a bit longer than red light. Humans can’t see this light, but we feel some of it as heat. (Have you ever walked past the embers of a campfire that’s no longer giving off light, but still feels warm? That heat energy is carried to your skin by infrared waves.)
Ground-based telescopes can’t pick up infrared light from space. Water vapor in the air absorbs most of it before it reaches the instruments. That vapor is in the troposphere, near Earth’s surface. To avoid this problem, airplanes are sometimes used as infrared observatories. Flying an infrared telescope above this lower layer of the atmosphere allows it to pick up infrared light from space. Planets like Jupiter glow brightly in infrared. Cool stars do, too.
Because infrared light can pass through clouds of dust in space, infrared telescopes can see behind the dust that would obscure other telescopes’ views.
Launched on December 25, 2021, the James Webb Space Telescope has been designed to see infrared light from the deepest parts of space. To do that, it has to stay super cold. Otherwise, its own heat would interfere with its observations. In order to stay cool, its orbit will be 1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) above Earth. That’s four times farther than the moon! This telescope will see planets in other solar systems and the formation of distant stars. It might even glimpse the first galaxies that formed after the Big Bang.
Microwave telescopes view the same type of energy that heats food in a microwave oven. After the Big Bang, the entire universe began to cool. Radiation left over from the Big Bang has been cooling for so long that it has very low energy. Lower energy light has longer wavelengths. So this light has even longer wavelengths than infrared light; they’re in the microwave part of the spectrum. As with infrared light, you need a space-based instrument to see these cosmic remnants of the Big Bang.
A space telescope called COBE — the Cosmic Background Explorer — measured that heat, just as a thermometer measures your body’s temperature. COBE found this cosmic microwave background in our universe is just 3 kelvins. That’s negative 270° Celsius (–450° Fahrenheit)! Astronomers can look at tiny ripples in those temperature measurements to map when and where the very first galaxies started to form.
Radio telescopes pick up wavelengths longer than infrared. (You might think that radio waves are sound waves. In fact, they are a form of light.) Spanning a huge range, radio wavelengths can be as wide as a mountain or as small as a few inches. There are lots of radio telescopes on Earth. Since radio waves are so long, radio telescopes do not have to collect them using smooth, polished surfaces like lenses or mirrors. In fact, many radio telescopes look more like wire mesh. The former Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico was an especially good example of how rough the surface of a radio telescope can be.
You might have seen pictures of networks of these dish-shaped telescopes, such as the Very Large Array in New Mexico and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array, or ALMA, in northern Chile. Astronomers have learned to use powerful math techniques to link these networks of telescopes together. Such networks can then mimic one super-big instrument. The Event Horizon Telescope is a network of 10 radio observatories across the entire planet. In 2019, it generated the first image of a black hole.
Collecting light shorter than the eye can see
Many wavelengths are far shorter — and higher in energy — than visible light. To picture why shorter wavelengths have higher energies, imagine holding a rope that is tied to something at the opposite end. It’s not very hard to slowly shake your end of the rope up and down. That low-energy motion creates long waves in the rope. If you shake the rope as fast as you can, that requires more energy. As a result, the waves in the rope get much closer together.
Ultraviolet (UV) telescopes focus on light whose wavelengths are just a bit shorter than violet light. You may have heard about this kind of light in terms of sunburn. Earth’s atmosphere blocks some of the sun’s UV rays. Still, much gets through. For astronomers, UV light can reveal stars hotter than our sun. Many young stars shine brightly in UV light, allowing us to learn a lot about how they form inside galaxies. UV waves can also be created when the shock wave of an exploding star, or supernova, slams into a cloud of dust or gas.
X-Ray telescopes visualize the same light that doctors use to see a broken bone. X-rays are shorter than both visible and UV light. In space, these wavelengths point to very high-energy objects, such as black holes and supernovas. On December 9, 2021, NASA launched a new X-ray telescope. Called IXPE — for Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer — it will explore how magnetic fields can shape and steer an object’s X-ray light.
Gamma-rays are the highest-energy wavelengths in existence. So gamma-ray telescopes point to extremes in space. Many cosmic sources of gamma rays remain a mystery. It’s up to scientists to explain where they come from. The only gamma-ray telescopes are in space. Sometimes they detect a sudden flare, called a gamma-ray burst. When this happens, telescopes of all kinds swing into action to see if the burst appears in visible or other wavelengths, too. That could help astronomers figure out the source of these strange, super-powerful bursts.
In their many forms, telescopes reveal details of objects in space that are invisible to our eyes. They help us to see farther. And they capture light that is too dim to otherwise notice. Just as color photographs show more than black-and-white, telescopes of all wavelengths reveal details of the cosmos that our unaided eyes could never see."
Science,"Space trash could kill satellites, space stations — and astronauts
The number of objects that make up space junk continues to grow every year
Seven astronauts aboard the International Space Station woke to unwelcome news on the morning of November 15, 2021. NASA, the U.S. space agency, was worried. The station was zooming directly into a suddenly dangerous area littered with trash. A collision could damage the spacecraft. And that could threaten the safety of everyone inside. NASA warned the astronauts to take cover.
The astronauts closed hatches between sections of the ISS and climbed into escape ships. Then they waited. Fortunately, they transited the area without a mishap. All clear.
Soon, the source of all that debris would be revealed. Earlier that day, the Russian government had launched a rocket to blow up a big satellite. The satellite hadn’t worked since the 1980s. This launch was testing a new missile technology.
While the missile did its job, the explosion created a “debris field.” The shattered satellite showered space with some 1,500 pieces of trash big enough to see and track by telescope. It also produced hundreds of thousands of smaller pieces. Even a small piece could have ripped a hole through the exterior of the ISS. And the threat from this one satellite may persist for years, if not decades.
Space junk races around the planet at up to 8 kilometers (5 miles) per second. The speed of an impact can reach 15 kilometers per second, or 10 times as fast as a bullet. NASA scientists estimate that a marble-sized piece could smash into another object with as much force as a bowling ball traveling at 483 kilometers (300 miles) per hour.
The ISS passes through the same spot every 93 minutes as it circles the planet. On that mid-November day, everyone aboard feared an impact. But this wasn’t the first or last time space junk had threatened a mission. The explosion prompted NASA to cancel a planned, November 30 spacewalk. The Chinese space station, with three astronauts on board, had to change course because of the Russian satellite. Just three days before the explosion, the ISS changed its orbit to avoid colliding with space junk left by an older, broken-down satellite. And on December 3, the ISS again changed course to avoid pieces from a different broken-down satellite.
Space junk is a growing menace. Indeed, this trash “is now the number one concern of people who study space-traffic management,” says Pat Seitzer. He’s an astronomer at the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor. He uses telescopes and computers to study orbital debris.
“We created this risk ourselves,” says Don Pollacco. Fortunately, he adds, “there’s stuff we can do to stop it from being a risk.” An astronomer at the University of Warwick in England, Pollacco runs the  new Center for Space Domain Awareness. Scientists there focus on the environment in outer space that’s closest to Earth. The debris problem, he warns, threatens the future of space traffic.
“If you don’t deal with it, sooner or later it will catch up,” he says. “You can’t ignore it forever.”
Tracking the trash
The European Space Agency, or ESA, estimates that about 36,500 pieces of debris larger than 10 centimeters (4 inches) now orbit Earth. There are about a million pieces between 1 and 10 centimeters in diameter. More than 300 million pieces still smaller litter near space, too. Scientists use radar to track the biggest pieces. The smallest? They’re too small to measure precisely.
Soviets launched the first satellite into space — Sputnik I — on October 4, 1957. Since then, governments, militaries and companies around the world have sent up tens of thousands more. In 2020 alone, more than 1,200 new satellites entered space — more than any previous year. Of more than 12,000 satellites sent into space, the ESA estimates that about 7,630 are still in orbit. Only about 4,800 still work.
Space debris has been growing for decades. Most of it resides in what scientists call a low-Earth orbit, or LEO. That means it orbits about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) above Earth’s surface. The ISS is also in low-Earth orbit.
Space debris includes big objects, such as pieces of rockets used to lift satellites into space. It also includes things such as nose cones and payload covers from those rockets. Then there are satellites that don’t work anymore — or failed from the start.
One is Envisat, a satellite ESA launched in 2002. It died 10 years into its mission of monitoring Earth’s climate. Its carcass will likely remain a threat for at least the next 100 years.
“It’s a big car crash in the sky just waiting to happen,” worries Pollacco.
A few big smashups have produced much of the known space debris. In 2007, China launched a missile to blow up one of its old weather satellites. The blast produced more than 3,500 pieces of large debris, as well as giant clouds of small pieces. In 2009, a defunct Russian satellite collided with a communications satellite owned by a U.S. company. This smashup also produced large clouds of debris.
The U.S. Department of Defense runs a Space Surveillance Network. It uses radar and other telescopes to track larger pieces of debris. This network now tracks more than 25,000 big chunks, according to NASA. When the chance that one of those chunks will collide with the ISS is greater than 1 in 10,000, the space station will move out of the way. Private companies have also started tracking debris in recent years.
Space trash can be quite diverse
In 1965, astronaut Ed White lost a glove during a spacewalk. Other astronauts have lost screwdrivers and other tools. Pieces of exploded batteries or fuel tanks — some with fuel still in them — are whizzing in orbit. So are flecks of peeled paint, nuts and bolts. At the speed they’re moving, all are dangerous.
Scientists can’t see pieces of debris as small as bolts, nuts and paint flecks. Instead, they study the scratches and dents these leave behind on existing satellites. During an inspection in May 2021, astronauts found that a robotic arm of the ISS had been damaged by space debris. The arm still works, but it has a hole about 0.5 centimeter (0.2 inch) across.
The Hubble Space Telescope has provided a wealth of data from similar encounters with debris. Astronauts have visited and repaired the telescope multiple times in the last three decades. Each time they have found hundreds of tiny craters in the solar panels. These were left by collisions with small pieces of debris. Scientists have been logging the pattern and incidence of these impacts. That data will help the scientists build computer models that predict not only how many tiny pieces remain in orbit, but also where they are.
Studies of space debris confirm the threat is growing, says Seitzer, in Michigan. “It’s a real problem.” But he worries that people aren’t learning the right lessons. After the 2007 event in which China blew up a satellite and created a giant debris field, he thought people would work hard on the space-trash problem. “I would have thought everybody would be convinced.”
But they weren’t. So the problem continues to grow.
The private company SpaceX has launched “constellations” of dozens of satellites. The company is using this project, called Starlink, to create a global internet system. Already, about 40 percent of active satellites in space belong to SpaceX. The company plans to launch thousands more. And they’re not alone. OneWeb, a communications company, has announced plans to launch its own constellation of 300,000 satellites.
When a company learns that its satellite is going to fly within 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) of another — or close to a piece of space junk — it can redirect its satellite a bit. In August, researchers in the United Kingdom reported that SpaceX Spacelink satellites have been involved in about half of all collision-avoidance moves in LEO. In the near future, they predict that share could rise to nine in every 10.
As the number of satellites in the sky mushrooms, so will the threat from collisions with debris, says Pallacco. “It’s a cumulative thing,” he says. “The less we do about it, the worse it gets.”
Beware the cascades
Astronomers worry that as space litter grows, these fragments also will interfere with telescope observations. “If you get enough of these collisions, you could brighten the night sky,” says Connie Walker. She’s an astronomer at the National Science Foundation’s NOIR Lab, in Tucson, Ariz.
She is concerned that space debris and satellites could limit the scientific study of space. That junk could reflect so much light that it hides the light of distant stars. Right now, scientists are trying to determine how space debris and the future flood of satellite constellations might affect telescope observations. For sensitive observatories, Walker says, “we need a sky that’s pretty clear and not highly light-polluted.”
Another less obvious risk is one that experts call the “Kessler Syndrome.” In 1978, NASA astronomer Donald Kessler looked at data on space debris and made an ominous prediction. Eventually, he said, LEO would accumulate so much space junk that it could trigger a cascade. The fragments from one collision would cause other collisions, he projected. Debris from those collisions would then cause more. And more, and more. This became known as the Kessler Syndrome, or Kessler Effect.
“We’re not there yet,” says Seitzer. But unless private companies, military operations and spacefaring governments take the problem seriously, he says, such a cascade could happen. “Even if we add nothing else, more collisions of existing things in orbit will create more debris.”
To the graveyard orbit!
Some experts worry that people won’t take the problem seriously until tragedy strikes.
“Most people haven’t had an issue with a satellite problem,” observes science historian Lisa Ruth Rand. She works at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. “If we were to lose a satellite that the defense uses, or if something falls from space, that’s when people get terrified. That’s when space junk is a problem.”
Yet make no mistake, she says, space debris is already an environmental hazard. And she’s not the first to point this out. NASA scientists have warned about the dangers of polluting near-Earth space since the 1960s.
There are also companies and scientists working on ideas for cleaning up the mess. But they will need different strategies depending on which part of space they’re cleaning, says Walker, the NSF astronomer in Tucson.
“The higher you go, the longer it takes” for a satellite to de-orbit, she explains. Big pieces in LEO could be redirected back toward the planet, to burn up in the atmosphere.
The Japanese company Astroscale has designed spacecraft that will magnetically “grab” space junk and drag it to a lower orbit, from where it would then fall and burn up in the atmosphere. The company launched a pair of the satellites into space to test the technology in March 2020.
“When it comes to orbital debris, there are a variety of approaches on how to handle these things,” says Tom McCarthy. He’s a robotics expert at Motiv Space Systems in Pasadena, Calif. McCarthy has been developing spacecraft that can fix and recycle old satellites. Such technology could help extend the working life of those satellites, he says.
Space junk farther out may require a different strategy. Big pieces in a geostationary orbit — about 36,000 kilometers (22,000 miles) up — could be sent to a “graveyard orbit.” They would be propelled an additional 300 kilometers (190 miles) away from Earth, where they would remain, far from where they could do any major damage.
“A satellite could dock or connect with a geostationary satellite and then take it to the disposal orbit and release it,” says McCarthy. That may already be happening. In late January 2022, a company called Exoanalytic Solutions, which monitors the space environment, reported a curious observation. A Chinese satellite flew close to a large, dead satellite and towed it away to a graveyard orbit.
Other experts say that plans for removing satellites from orbit need to be built into a craft’s design. That’s something Astroscale is doing. The company developed a magnetic docking station to bolt onto a satellite before launch. Later, when it needs repairs or removal, another vehicle can be sent up to collect it.
An international committee with members from space agencies around the world recommends that all new satellites have the ability to de-orbit themselves within 25 years. Some satellites are close enough to do that naturally. Others aren’t. Of the ones that are too high to de-orbit on their own, fewer than one in four can lower themselves out of orbit, according to a July 2019 ESA report.
Pollacco says satellite designers need to address the space-debris issue well before liftoff. But right now, he says, the operators of the satellites don’t see the problem. “It’s in everybody’s interest for this stuff to be cleaned up,” he says. “If it isn’t, it will become all of our problem.”"
Science,"Wild art? No, it’s a radio image of the heart of our Milky Way
Eyelash-like filaments accent the brightest spot — a supermassive black hole
There’s a new image that looks like a trippy Eye of Sauron. Or perhaps it’s a splatter of modern art. Actually, this image is a new detailed view of the Milky Way’s chaotic center. But it’s not what you’d see with the human eye. This photo was captured in radio wavelengths.
The image was taken with a radio-telescope array in South Africa. Its details emerged slowly over the course of three years. In all, the data for it required 200 hours of observing. The picture is a mosaic that comes from combining 20 separate images. The bright, star-dense galactic plane runs from left to right across the image. Researchers shared this spectacular cosmic view in a paper to be published in the Astrophysical Journal.
The MeerKAT telescopes captured the radio-wave light emitted by several cosmic treasures. These include stellar nurseries and exploding stars known as supernovas. An especially energetic region surrounds a supermassive black hole at our galaxy’s center. It shows up brightly. One puffy remnant left over from a supernova can be seen at the bottom right. And the supermassive black hole shows up as the bright orange “eye” in the center.
Other intriguing features include many wispy-looking radio filaments. Most of them slice up or down from the center of the image. A handful of them were first spotted in the 1980s. They are caused by accelerated electrons. The tiny particles create the glow in radio light as they gyrate in a magnetic field. But these filaments are hard to explain. There’s no obvious engine to accelerate those electrons.
“They were a puzzle. They’re still a puzzle,” says Farhad Yusef-Zadeh. He’s an astrophysicist at Northwestern University. It’s in Evanston, Ill. He discovered the filaments by accident while a graduate student.
Until now, scientists knew of so few filaments that they could only study them one at a time. Now MeerKAT has revealed hundreds, Yusef-Zadeh notes. Studying these strands as a group might help reveal their secrets, he and his colleagues report in a paper to be published in Astrophysical Journal Letters. “We’re definitely one step closer to seeing what these guys are about,” he says.
The MeerKAT observatory released data behind the new imagery so other scientists will be able analyze them, too. “There’s going to be a lot of science coming,” Yusef-Zadeh predicts."
Science,"Teen inventors say: There’s got to be a better way
Finalists in the 2022 Regeneron Science Talent Search are rethinking existing technologies to work better
Fictional inventors are often seen toiling away in big, fancy labs. Tony Stark’s workshop surrounds him with holographic screens. Jimmy Neutron stashes gadgets in a huge underground hideout. Willy Wonka has an entire factory. But real-world innovation doesn’t require such elaborate sets. Just ask the finalists of this year’s Regeneron Science Talent Search.
This annual event is the nation’s premier science and math competition for high-school seniors. It’s run by Society for Science. (Society for Science also publishes Science News for Students.) Each year, 40 finalists compete for more than $1.8 million in prizes — and show off their own feats of science and engineering.
The 2022 lineup includes several young inventors who have turned their basements, bathrooms and garages into workshops. The teens’ homemade tech could improve prostheses, earthquake-warning systems and air travel.
Mind over machine
Ben Choi’s goal is simple: Build machines that can read minds.
When only about eight years old, Ben became fascinated by mind-controlled prostheses. He saw a documentary on these artificial limbs, which are controlled by devices implanted in the brain. “I was really amazed,” recalls the now 17-year-old senior at the Potomac School in McLean, Va. “But it was also pretty alarming.” Implanting the electrodes required risky brain surgery. And those artificial limbs cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.
“They’re really not that accessible,” Ben says. “That always kind of stuck with me.”
In 2020, Ben set out to create his own non-invasive, low-cost bionic arm. He set up shop on a basement ping-pong table. His first prototype was built with a small 3-D printer borrowed from his sister. After updating his design more than 75 times, Ben has now showcased a refined version of the arm using industry-grade resin. It still costs less than $300 to make.
The arm is controlled by electrodes worn on the forehead. Those sensors eavesdrop on the brain’s electrical activity, or brainwaves. Thinking about different arm motions, such as waving or making a fist, creates different brainwave patterns. An artificial intelligence, or AI, system deciphers those brainwaves to move the robotic arm.
The AI system had to be trained to interpret those brainwaves. Ben gathered brainwave data from volunteers at his school and in his family. “From those participants, I collected maybe an hour or two of brainwave activity,” he says. “That’s many thousands of data points.” Studying those data helped the AI system learn to read minds.
In early tests, Ben’s robotic arm has proved about as nimble as the world’s best brain-controlled prostheses, he says. Those results need to be confirmed in a clinical trial. But if they hold up, this bionic arm could be a game-changer for prosthetic tech. And why stop at bionic arms? Similar AI systems could someday control mind-reading wheelchairs or other devices.
Personal earthquake detectors
The inspiration for Vivien He’s invention hit closer to home. She’s a senior at Palos Verdes Peninsula High School in Rolling Hills Estates, Calif. Growing up in Southern California, this 18-year-old has spent a lot of time huddling under her school desk during earthquake drills. These ground tremors are the world’s deadliest natural disasters. And they’re unpredictable.
Earthquake early warning systems do exist. One is the ShakeAlert system on the U.S. West Coast. Seismic stations in the ShakeAlert network detect ground vibrations when a quake strikes. Those stations then alert people that the ground under them may soon start to rumble. But it’s hard to predict how much the ground will shake at any given place. And people closest to an earthquake’s source are out of luck. They’ll feel the shaking before they can get an alert.
To give people a better read on the ground beneath their feet, Vivien built an at-home earthquake sensor. “I like to compare it to a smoke detector, but for earthquakes,” she says. Called the Qube, this device uses a motion sensor called a geophone to feel mild tremors that may mark the beginning of a bigger quake. Then, it can warn users by sounding an alarm or sending text alerts.
About the size of a Rubik’s cube, the Qube costs less than $100 to make. To build it, Vivien bought a soldering machine and watched YouTube videos to learn how to use it. Then she went to work in a spare bathroom. “I’ve always been a very hands-on person,” she says. She found it fun to assemble each new Qube — often with an old movie playing in the background.
During nine months of testing, Vivien’s Qube detected all earthquakes over magnitude 3 around Los Angeles. The motion data captured by her Qube also matched those from a nearby seismometer in the Southern California Seismic Network. Vivien shared those results in December in Seismological Research Letters.
Vivien is now building up a network of Qubes around Los Angeles. “I have eight devices in different homes,” she says. A widespread Qube network could serve a similar role as ShakeAlert seismic stations. When one Qube starts to shake, it could alert users across town of an oncoming quake. But unlike seismic stations, Qubes are tiny and inexpensive. So, many more of them could be installed around a city.
The ultimate goal is to create such a low-cost seismic network in low-income areas that may be more vulnerable to quakes, Vivien says. “I want to be able to place a network like what I’m building now in those kinds of communities across the world.”
Reinventing the wing
Like Ben and Vivien, 17-year-old Ethan Wong is revamping existing technology. His focus: airplanes.
Nearly all planes have a tail. The tail keeps the plane’s nose from swerving during a turn. The structure adds stability but weighs the plane down. Specially designed airplane wings could serve the same function as the tail. This could boost flight efficiency and cut the environmental cost of air travel. But there’s a catch. Those wings must twist in a very precise way that makes them hard to manufacture.
Ethan became fascinated by this kind of airplane design when he saw a video of NASA’s Prandtl-D aircraft gliding gracefully through the air without a tail. “I just thought that was really cool,” says Ethan. He’s a senior at Arcadia High School in California. Ethan builds model airplanes for fun. He wondered if he could find a simpler way to achieve the same tailless flight.
“Essentially what I did was just trial and error,” Ethan says. Using a computer model of an airplane wing, he tweaked the angle of twist along the wing until it could achieve tailless flight. Usually, such a wing “requires a continuous distribution of wing twist,” Ethan says. But he could achieve a similar effect with wings that had just a few sections of twist. “It’s super easy to make.”
In his garage, Ethan built model airplanes using foam and packing tape to test his design. “Seeing the plane in the air, that was pretty cool,” Ethan says. “It just flew really, really well.”
Lighter, more efficient planes could open the door to other air travel innovations. “It’s been a long-term goal of mine to build a solar plane that can fly through the day powered by solar panels on its wings,” Ethan says. “It is absolutely possible for a really efficient plane.”
To other teens who have big engineering ideas they want to explore, Ethan has one word: persistence. “Don’t ever give up,” he says. Even when some machinery feels impossible to understand, it helps to remember that the world’s greatest inventors were only human, too. “Also, just make sure you love whatever you do,” Ethan adds. “That’ll make pursuing everything a lot easier.”"
Science,"These flying robots protect endangered wildlife
Drones collect snot from whales, snap photos of rare monkeys, count penguins and more
SnotBot is on a mission. The toaster-sized drone flies over the open ocean, directly above a rare sei whale. On a boat nearby, Andy Rogan beams with joy. He’s been studying whales his entire career, but had never seen this species.
Rogan is a marine biologist with Ocean Alliance, an organization based in Gloucester, Mass. Right now, though, he’s on an expedition near the Azores — islands in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
All of a sudden, whuffff! The giant whale sends up a cloud of snot. It completely soaks the hovering drone.
Rogan cheers. That’s exactly what his team hoped would happen. SnotBot has a petri dish on board. Now, that dish contains sei whale snot, also known as whale blow. “Sometimes it smells sort of fishy,” says Rogan. “[It] has the consistency of water. It’s more like seawater than slime.” So maybe it’s not as gross as human boogers. But it does contain mucus. And the DNA in that mucus can give scientists important information about whales.
SnotBot also carries a camera. On some flights, operators remove the petri dish. Then they send the bot out to take pictures and videos of whales from above. Explains Rogan, “Drones have allowed us to get a clearer understanding of how whales swim, how they behave, how they interact and how many travel in a group.”
He and SnotBot aren’t alone. Around the world, people who work to better understand and protect wildlife are using drones to help the cause. Some are counting seabirds in colonies at the Falkland Islands in the remote South Atlantic. Others are tracking and counting endangered muriquis monkeys in Brazil and orangutans in Sumatra (an island in Indonesia). And in Africa, drones and camera traps are keeping an eye out for poachers who might harm rhinos and other protected animals.
SnotBot flies through the blow of blue whales in the Gulf of California off the coast of Mexico. The mucus in whale blow contains DNA. Researchers use these DNA samples to better track and understand whale populations.
Flying cameras
Wildlife researchers often trek through jungles and underbrush to find animals. They may peer at whales from boats or fly in helicopters to view animals from above. Such flights are very expensive and sometimes dangerous. Plus, their noise may scare animals. And helicopters can’t fly very far out over the ocean because there’s nowhere to land or refuel.  
Back in 2011, Lian Pin Koh and Serge Wich wondered if there might be an easier way to get similar types of data. “We both realized that counting animals is such an enormous effort,” says Wich. “We thought, ‘What if you fly over them with a flying camera?’”
Wich is an ecologist and conservation expert at Liverpool John Moores University in England. Koh is an ecologist at the National University of Singapore. Together, they cobbled together a drone from a remote-control model airplane, hacked camera equipment and sponges. The sponges absorbed the drone’s vibrations, explains Wich. That way the images wouldn’t be too blurry. At the time, it was possible to buy drones, but they cost tens of thousands of dollars. This do-it-yourself version cost less than $2,000. Wich and Koh call it a conservation drone.
And it did the trick. On a test flight, the drone captured an image of an orangutan in its nest at the top of a very tall tree. “That was a very exciting moment,” says Wich. The pair realized this was just the beginning of a whole new way of doing conservation work. They also started the group Conservationdrones.org to share what they were learning with other researchers across the globe.
Finding hidden monkeys
Fabiano Melo is one of those researchers at Federal University of Viçosa in Brazil. As an ecologist, he studies the Northern muriqui. This rare, large monkey inhabits the tropical forests of Brazil. “They live literally in peace,” says Melo. “Nobody fights about females or about food. They just eat flowers and leaves.” Yet these monkeys are critically endangered. Only some 1,000 remain in the wild.
Forest fires are their biggest threat. Most often, people set these fires to clear land for farming. Those fires also destroy the animals’ habitat. Melo must know where the muriquis are to make sure people aren’t allowed to set fires near them.
But finding rare monkeys in a vast jungle wasn’t easy — until he learned about drones. Melo piloted one for the first time in 2017. Now, he says, his colleagues call him “the master of drones.”
His latest drone, nicknamed “Dronequi,” has a hybrid camera. It can take regular photos and videos. Or it can use a thermal sensor to detect heat. Getting this sensor felt like a miracle to Melo. It could detect muriqui body heat even when the animals were hidden among the thick leaves and branches in tree canopies at the top of the forest.
During 2020, Melo and his team flew Dronequi over five different sites in Brazil. They discovered a group of 15 muriquis that no one had known existed. “When we find a new group, I go crazy,” he says. “I scream a lot. I have tears in my eyes.” Finding a new group means that there are more muriquis in the wild. Now Melo’s team can work with the government and private landowners to protect where these monkeys live. Or, if necessary, the team can move the animals to a site that’s safer or closer to others of their kind.
Counting penguins
Madeline Hayes is a drone pilot and graduate student at Boston University in Massachusetts. She remembers a time in college when she felt really discouraged. There seemed to be too many environmental issues plaguing the planet. When she discovered drone technology, though, she gained new energy. “You can get so much more data,” she says. And all those data mean that “you can explore brand new questions no one has been able to explore before.” Hayes has flown drones to investigate water quality in Morehead City Harbor in Beaufort, N.C., and invasive aquatic plants in the Lake Champlain Basin in Vermont.
For one recent project, though, she didn’t get to pilot the drones. A different team of researchers had already captured drone images from the Falkland Islands (also known as the Malvinas Islands). They’re just east of the southern tip of South America. The images showed colonies of thousands of black-browed albatrosses and southern rockhopper penguins. The two seabirds nest together.
A few decades ago, black-browed albatrosses were listed as endangered. Thanks to conservation efforts, their numbers have been growing. But southern rockhopper penguin populations are falling. That’s mostly because climate change and overfishing have made it harder for them to find food. They are considered vulnerable, which is slightly less worrying than the “endangered” label. But even vulnerable species could go extinct if nothing is done to help them. Experts need to keep an eye on both types of birds.
Before researchers had drones, they had to go to the islands and count birds manually. This was expensive and time-consuming. They could only afford to spend the time and money to do a full count once every five to 10 years. And a lot could happen to the birds between counts.
Hayes, though, came up with a way to count birds automatically from drone images. She used machine learning. This is an artificial intelligence, or AI technique that uses huge sets of examples to train a computer program. Afterward, that program can recognize patterns in data, such as penguins in camera images. In the beginning, Hayes says, “I did not have an AI background in the slightest.” But she found the resources she needed to figure it out.
The most time-consuming part was creating the examples needed to train and test the computer. She had to provide it with enough examples of each type of bird. The only way to do that was to go through thousands of images, one by one, drawing rectangles around every single bird — 45,000 in all. “I know it seems crazy,” she says. She got through it by listening to audiobooks while she worked.
Now that she’s done this, nobody will ever have to do it again. The model she trained can recognize both types of birds. It’s slightly better at finding albatrosses — they’re bigger and lighter in color. The penguins are more likely to resemble rocks or shadows. But the program does an excellent job with both. Ninety percent of its automatic counts matched manual human counts. That means the difference between the two counts was 5 percent or less.
Protecting rhinos and more
Serge Wich doesn’t have to build his own drones anymore. But he’s still tinkering. Wich and colleagues Carl Chalmers, Paul Fergus and Steven Longmore are building AI that automatically detects many types of animals. Chalmers and Fergus are computer scientists. Longmore is an astrophysicist. They all work at Liverpool John Moores University. They call their project Conservation AI. When someone uploads an image or video, the model analyzes the data. Then the model identifies anything it can. So far, it recognizes lions, elephants, rhinos, zebras, people, cars and much more.
To add a new species or object to this list, the Conservation AI team must follow the same process as Hayes. They must go through thousands of images, manually drawing and labeling rectangles.
Researchers can use this model to locate or count animals. Wich hopes someday people will also use it to protect animals from illegal hunting, known as poaching. Many wildlife preserves already use drones and camera traps to watch over protected species. But typically a ranger has to keep an eye on the camera feed. In the future, an AI model could keep watch instead. It could send automatic alerts when a drone or camera sees suspicious activity.
The team tested this idea in a study in East Africa, published last year. Students and staff at a field site in Tanzania pretended to be poachers. The researchers flew drones over the pretend poachers at different times of day. Sometimes the actors were walking. Other times they stood still. They might have been hidden under leaves or out in the open. Sometimes the researchers used drones equipped with regular cameras. At other times they had thermal cameras.
Overall, people looking at the drone images did a better job than the AI model at finding pretend poachers. The model picked out many things (such as shadows and rocks) that weren’t people at all. Yet the model also found poachers that most people missed. “We’re certainly pleased with the results,” says Wich. With a little more work, he thinks that systems like this will make it easier for rangers to better protect endangered animals.
Yet, he cautions, this technology won’t end poaching. The real solution is to make it impossible to sell endangered-animal parts or to make sure the people who want to sell them instead find other options for work.
In addition, he points out that many endangered species live in remote areas. Here, internet connections may be spotty or nonexistent. That matters because people must upload images and video via the internet to use Conservation AI.
There’s another problem, too. In low-income parts of the world, conservationists may not be able to afford the equipment needed to study and protect species. Drones help make this work a bit less costly. Rogan’s team recently published a paper describing exactly how to use drones to study whales. In the near future, these researchers hope that the resources and technology to do conservation work will become widely available anywhere in the world.
 “Tech,” Wich says, “needs to be accessible for everyone.”

Science,"This crumb-sized camera uses artificial intelligence to get big results
Its unique lens and approach to image processing are behind its great photos
Say cheese! Researchers have developed a tiny camera that takes amazingly clear photos. Just don’t sneeze while it’s in your hand. At the size of a coarse grain of salt, you may never find it again.
Smaller cameras could mean lighter smartphones and new James Bond–style gadgets. But that’s not all. Cameras on this scale could swim through the body, hitch a ride on an insect, scope out your brain or monitor hostile environments. And those are just a few of the possibilities.
How do you pack that much picture-taking power into something the size of a crumb? It takes a “radically different approach” to making a camera lens, says Felix Heide. He’s a computer scientist at Princeton University in New Jersey. His lab developed the camera with colleagues from the University of Washington in Seattle. The team shared its work in Nature Communications in November.
Cameras have two main parts: a lens and a sensor. The lens bends incoming light onto the sensor, where the image is recorded. Over the last few decades, sensors have gotten smaller and smaller. But lenses are another story. “Lenses haven’t been miniaturized at all,” Heide says. Most are designed little different today than they were in the 1800s.
Lenses are traditionally made by stacking curved pieces of glass or plastic. A curved surface bends light passing through. How the light bends depends on the curvature. A lens can be a single piece of glass. To bend light in more ways, you can stack several of them together.
Heide’s team took a totally different approach. They made a lens from a metasurface. These surfaces are super thin, human-made materials patterned with tiny structures. The structures are so small they’re measured in billionths of a meter (nanometers). Similar but slightly thicker materials are called metamaterials.
“Metamaterials interact with light in entirely new ways not found in nature,” explains Natalia Litchinitser. She’s an electrical engineer at Duke University in Durham, N.C. How they interact depends on the structures ― their shape, density, pattern and what they’re made from. This is also true of metasurfaces.
With the right design, metasurfaces can become miniature lenses or mirrors. That means they can squeeze into tiny spaces and reveal things people haven’t seen before. Another plus? They can be made for pennies. That’s because you can make them using the process developed for producing computer chips.
Still, Litchinitser cautions, this technology is relatively new and has its limits. For example, metasurface lenses often produce fuzzy pictures or pictures with colored halos around the edges. Litchinitser credits the new camera’s creators for developing computer programs to overcome those problems. For these programs, the researchers turned to artificial intelligence, or AI.
‘Learning’ to get better pictures
When TikTok or Snapchat recognizes your face in a photo and applies a filter, that’s AI at work. The more you use these features, the better their machine learning gets at identifying you. That’s because these programs learn from their mistakes.
With a similar approach, Heide’s team tackled two key challenges for metasurface cameras: lens design and image quality. To get a high-quality image they needed a metasurface with more than 1.5 million metal structures. But how should the structures be arranged to get the best picture? It would take far too much time and computing power to explore every possibility.
Luckily, there’s a shortcut. The team wrote a computer program that simulated light traveling through a lens and the picture it created. Then the program tweaked the lens design and ran the simulation again. It compared the new picture to the previous one and judged which was better. As the program cycled through different possibilities, it learned a bit each time about how best to tweak the design and get the best picture.
But even a perfect lens design won’t deliver crisp, clear pictures unless you tackle another challenge. No metasurface lens can perfectly focus all the light rays passing through. That introduces blurriness. To deal with this, the team wrote a second computer program. This one looked at images of a simulated scene. The images were blurry in different ways. By cycling through the images and comparing them to the original scene, the program learned to correct for each type of blurriness. The result: An image-processing program that made pictures sharp and in full focus.
A lens just 0.5 cubic millimeters (a 300-millionth of a cubic inch) in size now rivals the quality of a traditional camera lens 550,000 times that volume. Just like its much bulkier predecessor, the new camera’s pictures are crisp, colorful and capture a wide field of view. You could even take a selfie with it. For now, however, the team is being extra careful and keeping it away from noses.
Ethan Tseng is a computer-science graduate student in Heide’s lab. He co-led the project with a student from the University of Washington. “We’re living in very exciting times,” Tseng says. “We’re seeing all kinds of cool tech that can completely change the way we originally thought of building things.”"
Science,"Orcas can take down the largest animal on the planet
It’s a fight between the ocean’s top predator and the world’s largest animal
Killer whales are skilled assassins. They hunt everything from small fish to great white sharks. They’ve even been known to attack whales. But there had long been a question about whether killer whales — also known as orcas (Orcinus orca) — could kill the world’s largest animal. Now there’s no longer any doubt. For the first time, scientists have observed a pod of orcas bring down an adult blue whale.
“This is the biggest predation event on the planet,” says Robert Pitman. He is a cetacean ecologist who works at the Oregon State University Marine Mammal Institute in Newport. “We haven’t seen things like this since dinosaurs were here, and probably not even then.”
On March 21, 2019, a team of scientists in Western Australia headed out on a boat to observe orcas. Little did they realize they would see something no one had seen before. They shared their whale tale January 21 in Marine Mammal Science.
It was “a really ominous, bad-weather day,” recalls John Totterdell. He is a biologist at the Cetacean Research Centre. It’s in Esperance, Australia. When he and his group were still an hour away from their usual orca-observing site, they slowed down to remove some debris from the water. It was pouring rain, so it was hard to see the splashing at first. Then they noticed the telltale dorsal fins of killer whales.
“Within seconds, we realized they were attacking something big. Then,” says Totterdell, “we realized, oh my, it was a blue whale.”
A dozen orcas were attacking an adult blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus). Their prey appeared to be between 18 and 22 meters (59 and 72 feet) long. Its flank was covered in tooth marks. Most of its dorsal fin had been bitten off. The most brutal injury was on its face. The flesh of the whale’s snout was ripped away along the top lip, exposing bone. Like a battering ram, three orcas slammed into the whale’s side. Then another orca began feeding on its tongue. The blue whale finally died about an hour after the research team arrived.
Anatomy of an attack
Orcas tend to use the same methods every time they attack a large whale. They bite the whale’s fins, tail and jaw. This may be to slow it down. They also push the whale’s head underwater to prevent it from surfacing for air. Some may push it up from below so the whale can’t dive. “These are practiced large-whale hunters,” notes Pitman, who was an author of the paper. “They know how to do this.”
Orca hunts are brutal and usually involve the whole family. Females lead the charge. Orca calves will watch closely and sometimes join the ruckus. They’re almost “like excited little puppies,” says Pitman. The orcas will even share their meal with their extended family. The research team observed about 50 orcas picnicking on the blue whale after it died.
Blue whales not only are enormous but also can be fast in short bursts. This makes them hard to take down. But other than that, they don’t have many of the defenses that other whales use. Scientists have reported, for instance, that southern right whales whisper to calves to avoid catching the orcas’ attention.
The new paper also describes two other successful attacks carried out by many of the same orcas. The group killed a blue whale calf in 2019 and a juvenile blue whale in 2021. The events happened in the waters off Bremer Bay in Western Australia. It’s where a continental shelf under the ocean drops off into deeper waters. Here, migrating blue whales pass by a resident population of more than 150 orcas. It may be the largest grouping of orcas in the world.
The oceans used to host many more large whales. But in the 1900s, humans killed nearly 3 million of them. As many as 90 percent of blue whales disappeared.
No one knows if large whales played a significant role in orca diets in the past. It’s definitely possible, though, says Pete Gill. He is a whale ecologist at Blue Whale Study in Narrawong, Australia. Orcas and blue whales have been interacting for tens of thousands of years, he points out. “I imagine they have had this dynamic for quite a long time.”"
Science,"Analyze This: Birds may decorate nests to scare off rivals
Feathers can make nests look like a kill site where birds don’t want to be caught dead
Some birds are interior decorators, placing big, showy feathers in their nests. But rather than spiffing up their homes, these birds may be trying to spook nest-stealing neighbors.
Karen Wiebe is a behavioral ecologist. She studies animal behavior and ecosystems at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada. Birds sometimes weave feathers into their nests to provide insulation. But Wiebe and her colleague, Tore Slagsvold of the University of Oslo in Norway, also saw birds placing large feathers on the surfaces of nests. Those feathers wouldn’t help with warmth. The researchers wondered whether the birds might be using the decorations to send a message.
For swallows and other birds that nest in holes and hollows, competition for nests can “be really ferocious,” Wiebe says. Birds scream, grapple and peck, sometimes killing an opponent. But these somewhat scarce holes can also hide danger. Owls, weasels or other predators may be lurking inside. If a nest contains feathers or other remains, it might be evidence that a predator had been there. Those holes might not be as desirable.
Wiebe and Slagsvold hypothesized that some birds may use feathers to create a mock kill site. Their goal: Scare competitors away.
During spring, when nest competition is fiercest, the scientists set up pairs of nesting boxes. One box contained white feathers. The other either contained no feathers or black feathers. Inside the boxes, black feathers were more difficult to see than white ones. Using video cameras, the researchers spied on how tree swallows, blue tits and pied flycatchers reacted to the boxes. They watched how long birds waited to explore a nest box. When birds took longer to enter, that suggested the animals were scared.
Birds of all three species hesitated to enter boxes with white feathers. But when feathers were in front of a nest, birds hopped right up and grabbed them. That suggested that birds weren’t afraid of the feathers themselves. The scientists shared their findings November 21 in Royal Society Open Science.
“It was really interesting to discover that birds were using a deceptive trick to help them keep their nests,” Wiebe says. When a bird leaves its nest to search for food, that opens the door for a nest stealer. “But if it can buy a little time by scaring away intruders with these feathers, then it has a better chance of coming back in time to defend its nest site.”

Science,"The end of the dinosaurs appears to have come in springtime
Fish fossils from North Dakota suggest when an Earth-devastating asteroid hit off Mexico
About 66 million years ago, a massive asteroid slammed into the Gulf of Mexico. Not long afterward, all nonbird dinosaurs died as did many other species on land and in the sea. Scientists don’t know the exact year this took place. But they now think they have figured out in what season it occurred: spring.
The finding comes from a new analysis of bones. These fossils of ancient fish had been entombed at a site in southwestern North Dakota. It’s known as Tanis.
Researchers shared their new discovery February 23 in Nature.
The asteroid was big — some 10 kilometers (more than 6 miles) across. It struck with a mighty force off the Mexican coast, close to the modern-day town of Chicxulub (CHEEK-shuh-loob). Many birds, small mammals and other creatures survived the global devastation this collision unleashed. Pinning down the season when it happened could help scientists better understand why these species were able to persist amidst a general global reign of death.
If the spring date proves correct, for instance, creatures that winter in underground burrows would have just been emerging and active in the Northern Hemisphere. This would have left them very vulnerable. In contrast, this same time would have been autumn in the Southern Hemisphere. Any hibernating creatures there should have been more protected, having just settled in for a season-long nap.
Telltale bands of growth
Scientists discovered the Tanis fossil site in 2008. Its sediments appear to capture the flooding of a riverbed and other destruction that happened immediately after the Chicxulub impact. Previous work also suggested that some fish fossils here had tiny round shapes on them. These appear to be solidified globs of molten and vaporized rock — material that had been flung skyward by the asteroid impact. And tiny globs were in the fishes’ gills. That’s a strong sign that the animals were alive and breathing as devastation rained down upon them.
“These creatures died incredibly close to the moment that debris was coming down,” says Thomas Holtz Jr. He’s a vertebrate paleontologist who did not take part in the new study. He works at the University of Maryland in College Park.
Some fish bones have features that can record seasonal and annual cycles of growth. These are similar to the growth rings in trees. Such patterns in bone typically appear as alternating thick and thin bands. The thick ones develop during a time of vigorous growth. The thinner bands mark times of slower bone growth. There’s also a third type of feature known as a “line of arrested growth.” It usually points to winter — or sometimes to periods of famine or drought.
Melanie During is a vertebrate paleontologist at Uppsala University in Sweden. To figure out in which season the asteroid struck, she and her colleagues examined the jawbones of three paddlefish. They also looked at bony spines in the pectoral fins of three sturgeons. The outermost layers of all six analyzed bones indicate rapid growth, During says. But that growth hadn’t yet reached the peak seen in previous years’ bands. Growth tends to peak in summer. So the last growth band in the Tanis fossils points to these fish having died before summer.
The regularity of the lines of arrested growth seen in the fish bones also suggests strongly that the fish weren’t suffering from drought or famine when they died. In fact, During says, “By all indications, these fish were doing fine.” Taken together, she says the fossils point to the Northern Hemisphere spring as when the dino-killing impact took place.
“I really do think this is a solid story backed by strong evidence,” says Stephen Brusatte. He’s a vertebrate paleontologist who works at the University of Edinburgh, in Scotland. The asteroid impact “would have turned a season that is normally about growth and flowering and rebirth into a time of unbelievable fire and fury,” he notes.
Despite the passage of more than 66 million years, Holtz says, “it’s pretty amazing that we can look at Earth’s worst day and figure out the time of year it was.”"
Science,"Americans tend to see imaginary faces as male, not female
It’s not yet clear why this gender bias exists
Have you ever seen the outline of a face in a cloud? Or perhaps in the pattern of your carpet? Or some other everyday object? This phenomenon is very common. It’s called pareidolia. Much is still unknown about how people perceive such imaginary, or “illusory” faces. But a new study has uncovered one curious detail. People are more likely to see illusory faces as male than female. Researchers shared that finding on February 1. It appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
The research was led by Susan Wardle. She works at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. This cognitive neuroscientist is fascinated by illusory faces. “They’re an example of face perception that’s incorrect,” she says. “And often by studying the mistakes of our brain, we can better understand how it works.” 
One day while looking at photos of illusory faces in the lab, Wardle wondered: “Where’s all the female faces?” Even though the faces appeared in nonliving objects with no gender, most appeared male to her.
Wardle was curious whether other people shared this bias. So she and her colleagues recruited over 3,800 people online. All were adults living in the United States. These volunteers viewed about 250 photos of illusory faces. The faces appeared in a variety of objects, from potatoes to suitcases. Participants labeled each one as male, female or neither.
Illusory faces were labeled male about four times as often as they were female. Both male and female participants showed that bias. About 80 percent of people labeled more images male than female. Only 3 percent judged more images to be female than male.
“We had a hunch that there would be a male bias,” Wardle says. “But I think we were surprised firstly by how strong it was. And also, how robust it is … we’ve replicated it in many experiments.”
In other experiments, Wardle’s team tried to learn why this gender bias might exist. In one test, the researchers showed people images of the same kinds of objects that were in the illusory face photos. But this time, the objects did not contain a facelike pattern. Participants labeled these images male and female about equally. This showed there was not something about the objects themselves that had made the illusory faces seem male or female. Computer models that searched the illusory face photos for “masculine” or “feminine” features — such as more angular or curved features — couldn’t explain the bias, either.
“There’s this asymmetry in our perception,” Wardle says. An illusory face is a very basic pattern of a face. Given such a basic pattern, “we’re more likely to see it as male,” Wardle says. “It requires additional features to see it as female.” This makes sense, she adds. Think of female emojis and Lego characters. They are often distinguished from male ones by extra features, such as bigger lips and longer lashes.
It’s not yet clear why people assume simple faces are male, Wardle says. But in a more recent study, her team found the same gender bias in kids as young as five. This suggests the bias arises early in life.
“I was not surprised that people would assign gender to illusory faces,” says Sheng He. But he was surprised by the strength of the gender bias that Wardle’s team discovered. He is a cognitive neuroscientist, too. He works at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. Future studies, He says, could test whether the same bias exists among people in other cultures."
Science,"Nodding off may turn your creativity on
Insights may come just as you shift from between being awake to being asleep
The twilight time between full wakefulness and being sound asleep may be packed with creative potential. In a new experiment, people who drifted into a light sleep were better problem solvers later. 
Scientists shared those findings December 8 in Science Advances. The results help demystify the fleeting early moments of sleep. They may even point out ways to boost creativity.
Thomas Edison inspired the new study. Rumor has it that the famous inventor used to chase the twilight moments between wakefulness and sleep. Supposedly, he used to fall asleep in a chair holding two steel balls. As he drifted off, the balls fell into metal pans. The resulting clatter woke him. Then, he could write down his inventive ideas before he fell into a deep sleep and forgot them.
Researchers tested Edison’s method of cultivating creativity with 103 healthy people. Volunteers came to the lab to solve a tricky number problem. They were asked to convert a string of numbers into a shorter sequence. They were told to follow two simple rules. What the volunteers weren’t told was that there was an easy trick to do this task. The second number in the sequence would always be the correct final number, too. Once discovered, this trick dramatically cut the solving time.
After doing this task 60 times, the volunteers earned a 20-minute break. This downtime was spent in a quiet, dark room. Volunteers reclined in chairs and held a version of the steel balls that Edison used as “alarm clocks” — it was a light drinking bottle in one dangling hand. The researchers told participants to close their eyes and rest or sleep if they desired. All the while, electrodes monitored their brain waves.
About half of the participants stayed awake. Twenty-four fell asleep and stayed in the shallow, fleeting stage of sleep called N1. Fourteen others progressed to N2, a deeper stage of sleep.
After their rest, participants returned to their number problem. The researchers saw a stark difference between the groups. People who had fallen into a shallow, early sleep were 2.7 times as likely to spot the hidden trick as people who stayed awake. Shallow sleepers were 5.8 times as likely to spot the trick as people who reached the deeper N2 stage.
Such drastic differences in such experiments are rare, says Delphine Oudiette. She’s a cognitive neuroscientist at the Paris Brain Institute in France. “We were quite astonished by the extent of the results,” she says.
Her team also turned up a “creative cocktail of brain waves,” as Oudiette puts it. These seemed to accompany the twilight stage of sleep. That cocktail was a mixture of alpha brain waves and delta waves. Alpha waves usually mark relaxation. Delta waves are a sign of deeper sleep.
The study doesn’t prove that the time spent in N1 actually triggered later creativity, says John Kounios. He’s a cognitive neuroscientist, too. But he wasn’t involved in the study. He works at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pa. Stewing over the problem may have just caused these volunteers to both nod off and to have their later insight, he says. In that case, N1 sleep would be a “by-product of the processes that caused insight rather than the cause.”
More work is needed to untangle the link between N1 and creativity, Oudiette says. But the results raise an interesting possibility. People may be able to learn to reach that twilight stage of sleep — or to produce the cocktail of brain waves associated with creativity — on demand.
It seems Edison was onto something about the creative powers of nodding off. But don’t put too much stock in his habits. He also is said to have considered sleep “a criminal waste of time.”"
Science,"Concussion patients should avoid screen time for first two days
Teens may find that hard, but it could speed recovery, a new study finds
If you get a concussion, stay off screens for a couple of days. That could help you recover and get back to normal activities sooner, new data suggest.
Those findings emerge from a study of 125 patients who came to a Massachusetts hospital’s emergency room within 24 hours of a head injury. All were diagnosed with a concussion.
Researchers randomly assigned the patients, all between the ages of 12 and 25, to two groups. Both groups had a mix of male and female patients. Doctors told all of them to avoid school or work for the first 48 hours, including online work for classes or jobs. They also instructed patients in one group to avoid other screen time for 48 hours. That meant no phones. No TV. No computers. The other group could use screen devices if they wanted, just not for school or work.
For three days after leaving the hospital, people in both groups answered questions about their symptoms. They also reported how many minutes they had used a screen. Over the next week, patients reported on their daily activities and continued the symptom survey. Doctors judged the patients to have recovered when their tally on a symptom survey was 3 or less, out of a total possible score of 132.
Both groups had trouble steering clear of screens. Even those told to avoid all screen access still logged an average of 130 minutes within the first three days. Patients in the other group spent an average of 630 minutes with their screens.
All of the patients got better. On average, though, people with less screen time improved sooner. The “no-screen” group’s recovery time was roughly 3.5 days, compared to 8 days for patients in the other group.
Ted Macnow and his team shared their results in the September 7 JAMA.
Macnow is a children’s emergency medicine doctor. He works at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester and the UMass Memorial Children’s Medical Center there. “Definitely,” he says, using screens in the first two days after a concussion “prolongs your symptoms.” 
He wasn’t surprised. Rest and quiet can help the brain heal after an injury, he explains. The problem with those screens is that they stimulate the brain with light. Some activities also play loud sounds, which ups the stimulation load even more.
Teens spend a lot of time on phones, computers and tablets, as well as in front of the TV. Their screen time, one 2019 U.S. survey found, averages about seven hours per day. Those data, from a report by Common Sense, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco, Calif., didn’t even include time spent on screens for school or homework.
Not surprisingly, debate about screen time’s possible effects in people with concussions has raged for years. Until now, however, “no one had ever actually done a specific study looking at that question,” Macnow says. Meanwhile, “every single parent and kid wanted to know what they could do [while recovering] at home.”
How might screen time hurt?
Why screens slow recovery is unclear, Macnow says. The light they emit might overwhelm a brain needing rest to heal. Or, he suggests, screen time might take the place of other activities, like getting out for a walk. He and other researchers are still trying to figure out how much activity is helpful. Screens can even mess with people’s sleep. And, Macnow points out, “we know that sleep is very important for dealing with concussions.”
Andre Obenaus says “this is an interesting study, because they’ve really gone out of their way to quantify it.” A brain scientist, Obenaus works at the University of California, Irvine. Overall, he says the group’s new study adds support to the idea that reduced brain activity right after a concussion aids recovery.
The new study only looked at patients who sought medical help, Obenaus notes. It’s unclear whether the same findings would hold for less severe cases. He also wonders why the team chose to avoid screens for just two days. Might doing so longer aid recovery even more? And is there a difference in benefits between girls and boys? Some research, he notes, has suggested the female brain may be more sensitive to sports concussions.
Macnow’s group recommends recruiting more participants for further study. They also agree with Obenaus that the study raises more questions. In the future, says Macnow, “we’ll be looking at particular types of screen time and if one is much worse than the others.” For now, he offers clear advice: “If you get a concussion, you should be avoiding screens for at least two days.”"
Science,"Why some icicles become scallops not spikes
The newfound quirky shapes reflect the surrounding water’s density
Water’s density can have wacky impacts that researchers are still discovering. New experiments show, for instance, that ice columns submerged in liquid water can melt into three distinct shapes. Which they become will depend on the water’s temperature.
Leif Ristroph is a mathematician in New York City. He was part of a team at New York University that anchored in place cylinders of ultrapure ice. Each cylinder was up to 30 centimeters (11.8 inches) long. Typically, liquids become denser the cooler they get. But freshwater is densest at 4° Celsius (39.2° Fahrenheit). At lower temps, the water becomes less dense. To test how that might affect the melting ice, the researchers submerged their ice cylinders in water between 2 °C and 10 °C (35.6 °F and 50 °F).
And “almost everything” about the experiments was surprising, Ristroph now reports.
The ice melted into smooth, downward-pointing spikes when placed in water cooler than about 5 °C (41 °F). When the researchers used a computer to model this behavior, it showed “a strange thing,” Ristroph says. “The cold liquid water near the ice is actually buoyant.” It wants to float because it is less dense than the rest of the water in the tank. That upward flow of melt water draws warmer water closer to the ice’s base. And this causes ice near the bottom to melt faster than at the top.  
The opposite occurred when the water was warmer than about 7 °C (44.6 °F). Now the ice formed an upward-pointing spike. The colder water near the ice is now denser than the body of water around it. So that colder water sinks. This pulls in warmer water at the top of the ice, causing it to melt faster than at the bottom, the computer model explains.
Between about 5 °C and 7 °C, the ice melted into scalloped columns. “Basically, the water is confused,” Ristroph says. It ends up forming layers of different densities. Some layers tend to rise as others sink. In the end, the water organizes itself into “swirls or vortices of fluid.” And this carves “weird ripples into the ice,” he observes.
His team shared its new findings January 28 in Physical Review Letters.  
Not the end of the story
“Our applied-math lab studies fluid dynamics,” Ristroph says. This work, he says, was its “first little dip into ice.” More work is needed to understand the complex mix of factors that can trigger the varying shapes that form as ice melts in nature.
The water in these tests, he notes, was “all quiet” when the experiments began. But in nature, motion can be created by all sorts of things — swimming animals, boats full of people, cargo and more.
And next, Ristroph plans to study what happens to the ice when the saltiness — or salinity — of seawater varies along with temperature.
He’s also started looking at what happens when ice cylinders are put in the tanks without anchoring them in place. Such free ice, Ristroph points out, can “move or flip over.” His team is curious how all of these movements may affect the shapes that melting ice can take on — whether as cubes in your glass or icebergs on the high seas.
The study of ice contains “a beautiful set of problems,” Ristroph says. “I think you could spend a whole career just on ice and never run out of stuff to do.”"
Science,"Explainer: How do mass and weight differ?
The two are related, but definitely not the same
In everyday life, we often use the words “mass” and “weight” as if they’re the same. But in science, it’s important to be precise. Mass and weight are both measurements that describe heaviness, but they actually mean very different things. Let’s be specific!
Mass is a measurement of the amount of matter in some object. It depends only on what type of atoms the object is made of, and how many atoms there are. Mass is traditionally measured in kilograms (kg). A pineapple or a wooden baseball bat each have a mass of about 1 kilogram.  
If you were to measure out 1 kilogram of steel and 1 kilogram of feathers, they would each have the same mass. But their volumes would differ. You’d need a far bigger volume of feathers because most of the elements they’re made from are lighter than those in steel. It takes more of those atoms to build up the same mass — which takes up more space.
People in the United States rarely describe objects using kilograms in daily life. Scientists and doctors use this term because it is the standard unit of mass in the metric system. (A standard unit is a definition that all scientists agree on.)   
You can change an object’s mass by removing some of its parts. When you take books out of your backpack at the end of a school day, you’ve decreased the backpack’s mass. Mass can also change by adding more matter. When a child grows, their body is building longer bones and bigger organs. The child’s mass will increase because they are transforming food energy into matter for their body.
It’s important to know that mass doesn’t change by varying its shape, location or size. Your body’s mass is the same when you’re curled up on the sofa or when you stretch as high as you can. And it’s the same when you’re at home or at the beach or at school! But your mass is a little bit more after you’ve eaten breakfast, compared with when you first wake up in the morning. Mass is a fundamental measurement of how much matter an object contains.
Weight is a measurement of the gravitational force on an object. It not only depends on the object’s mass, but also on its location. Therefore, weight is actually a measure of force. In the United States, most people measure weight in pounds.
Let’s say that your body has a mass of 40 kilograms. Your mass is 40 kilograms on Earth, on the moon, on Jupiter — and even floating inside the International Space Station. Your mass is 40 kilograms no matter where you are. But your weight differs from place to place because of differences in how hard gravity at each site pulls on you. On Earth’s surface, 1 kilogram of mass is equivalent to 2.2 pounds of weight. So your 40-kilogram mass on Earth would weigh 40 x 2.2 — or 88 pounds.
Language can get tricky here. Scientifically, you shouldn’t say, “My doctor measured my weight as 40 kilograms,” because weight isn’t the same as mass. It would be similarly incorrect to say, “My doctor measured my mass as 88 pounds.” However, since we all experience the same strength of Earth’s gravity on our mass, in casual language we often use mass and weight interchangeably. In much the same way, most people feel comfortable describing mass in pounds and weight in kilograms.
To avoid this confusion, scientists use a standard unit for force. It’s called the newton (in honor of Isaac Newton). On Earth, 100 newtons of weight (a force) is equal to about 22 pounds. This is a measure of how hard Earth’s gravity pulls on a mass of about 10 kilograms.
Mass and weight are proportional
As the mass of something rises or falls, its weight will change in the same way. And if the gravitational force on something rises or falls, its weight will also. In short, the mass of something rarely changes, but there are multiple ways its weight can change.  
The gravity you’d feel on the surface of a planet depends on its density. We say that Earth has the gravitational force of one “G.” The moon is much smaller and less dense than Earth. Its gravity is one-sixth G. Although Jupiter is much, much bigger than Earth, it’s not very dense. So Jupiter’s gravity is 2.5 G.
If your mass is 40 kilograms on Earth, your 88-pound weight would drop to 15 pounds on the moon. On Jupiter, you’d weigh 220 pounds. On the International Space Station, floating in orbit, your weight would be zero. But your mass would stay the same — 40 kg — in all of these places. For that reason, mass is a fundamental property of matter and weight is not.
Rocket launches offer an interesting example of how mass and weight relate. At launch, the rocket is full of fuel, so its mass is greatest. At Earth’s surface, it also feels the maximum pull of gravity. So its weight is heaviest. A few minutes after launch, the rocket has burned through a huge portion of its fuel. This means it has lost mass as that fuel has been transformed into energy. In addition, the rocket is farther from Earth’s surface. Gravity therefore pulls on it with even less force. Both the rocket’s mass and its weight have dropped. The rocket’s engines can now push the rocket even faster than they could at launch. (Next time you watch a rocket launch, notice how huge those launch engines are!)"
Science,"Scientists Say: Dark Energy
This mysterious force is driving the universe to expand at an ever-faster rate
Dark energy is a mysterious force causing the universe to expand faster and faster. No one knows exactly what it is. But if it keeps stretching out space, it may someday tear the cosmos to shreds.
The universe has been expanding ever since the Big Bang, about 14 billion years ago. But scientists long thought that gravity would rein in this expansion. Perhaps the universe would keep swelling, but more slowly. Or someday gravity might cause the universe to collapse back in on itself. That doomsday scenario is called the “Big Crunch.”
In 1998, though, those predictions were upended. Astronomers had been peering at supernovae — the explosions of distant stars. Measuring the distances to those explosions let scientists calculate how fast the universe was expanding. And the results shocked them. The universe appeared to be flying apart faster than ever before. Even now, scientists can’t explain why. But they have dubbed the phantom force pushing the cosmos apart “dark energy.”
Dark energy can’t be measured directly. But scientists can estimate how much there is based on how fast the universe is expanding. Dark energy makes up about 70 percent of all the contents of the universe. (Those contents include both matter and energy.) Another 25 percent the total stuff in the universe is an invisible substance called dark matter. The rest — a measly 5 percent — is normal matter. That’s the stuff that makes up all visible objects in the universe.
The nature of dark energy is one of science’s greatest mysteries. Maybe it is a property of empty space. Maybe it’s some kind of energy fluid or field that fills space. Some theorists have dubbed that cosmic broth “quintessence.” Others think the expanding universe could be explained by a new theory of gravity.
Since we don’t know what dark energy is, it’s hard to predict how it will behave. Far in the future, perhaps dark energy will overcome the forces holding the universe together. The universe would then tear itself apart. Such runaway expansion is called the “Big Rip.” So dark energy is key not just for understanding the cosmos today. It’s also key to understanding the ultimate fate of the universe.
In a sentence
Observations made by the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope could offer new clues into the nature of dark energy."
Science,"Explainer: What is sickle cell disease?
C-shaped blood cells can get caught in vessels, causing pain and worse
Our genes serve as an operating manual for cells of the body. Genes tell cells what to do and when. But copying errors in those operating manuals — known as mutations — can lead to misspelled instructions that can change how cells operate. Scientists now know that some of those mutations can lead to disease. Others offer benefits. Some can do both. And the mutation that underlies sickle cell disease is one that can be both good and very bad.
Sickle cell disease is caused by a molecular change in the body’s hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin is the molecule in red blood cells that transports oxygen to tissues throughout the body. It wasn’t until 1949 that scientists learned altered hemoglobin causes red blood cells to take the shape of crescent moons. In fact, this condition was the first known example of a disease linked to inherited changes in a molecule.
Hemoglobin normally allows “red blood cells to be very floppy and pliable, and slip and slide through the blood vessels easily,” says Erica Esrick. She’s a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Both are in Boston, Mass.
But a mutation in a single hemoglobin-making gene — the HBB gene — underlies sickle cell disease. This mutation makes hemoglobin stack in long strings inside blood cells. It gives those cells an inflexible, sickle — or crescent-moon — shape. Instead of being “squishy,” the now-stiff red blood cells get stuck inside blood vessels. This can cause severe and debilitating pain. Worse still, the sickle cells can literally block blood flow and the movement of oxygen into nearby tissues.
Most people with sickle cell disease live only into their late 40s. Among other reasons, the blocked blood vessels that this disease often causes can lead to strokes or organ damage.
To develop this disease, people must inherit that mutant HBB gene from both parents. If they get the mutant from one parent only, their blood cells can work normally.
Sickle cell affects millions of people around the world. In the United States, for instance, about 100,000 people live with the disease. Most of them are Black or Latino. The mutation behind it is particularly common in people whose ancestors came from parts of Africa that are south of the Sahara, from parts of the Middle East or from Southeast Asia. Why? It turns out that these areas have high rates of malaria.
Malaria afflicts an estimated 241 million people. In 2020 alone, it killed an estimated 627,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. And the mutant HBB gene makes the body resistant to infection by the parasite that causes malaria. Once the mutant gene first emerged, it spread widely in parts of the world where it conferred this resistance to malaria. But that benefit is overshadowed when someone inherits the mutant gene from both parents and develops sickle cell disease.
A bone marrow transplant is currently the only cure for sickle cell disease. A new marrow can make unsickled red blood cells. But such transplants are costly. Finding a matched donor to contribute marrow also is challenging, Esrick notes. That’s one reason researchers have begun looking to replace the mutant HBB genes. Esrick is part of one research team that is currently trying to fight the disease through such gene therapy."
Science,"Sickle-cell gene therapies offer hope — and challenges
Doctor Erica Esrick discusses existing treatments and an ongoing clinical trial
Medicines used to consist only of potions, salves and pills that doctors dispensed to treat or cure disease. Most have come a long way since your great-grandparents’ day. In fact, scientists are learning to treat some of the most troubling ailments — inherited diseases — at the cellular level. These therapies attack the problem at its source: our genes. One such therapy that shows particular promise takes aim at the first known inherited genetic disorder: sickle cell disease.
The rate of people born with this disease varies around the globe. In the United States, about 3 in every 200 babies are born with the mutation that causes their red blood cells to sickle (take a curved shape). These cells don’t live long. Since they carry oxygen throughout the body, their untimely demise causes anemia. It also decreases the delivery of oxygen to cells throughout the body. Their unusual sickle shape also means affected blood cells can block blood vessels, causing intense pain and worse, such as a stroke.
Gene therapies look to replace, turn off or fix missing or broken genes. Some could bring a true cure. But the journey to today’s handful of approved gene therapies — including certain blood cancers — has been rocky. Human trials in the 1990s didn’t achieve success. Others a decade later brought unintended and sometimes deadly impacts, including leukemia.
But many researchers believe sickle cell is an especially good target for gene therapy. The reason: Its underlying genetic problem is well understood.
Erica Esrick is co-leading a clinical trial that is testing a gene therapy for sickle cell disease. She’s a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School.  Both are in Boston, Mass. The new treatment works to encourage the body to make more of a healthy type of hemoglobin.
Hemoglobin is the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. Malfunctioning hemoglobin causes sickle cell disease. The healthy type of hemoglobin that Esrick’s treatment encourages the body to produce is known as fetal hemoglobin. It’s the type made by infants and young babies, but not adults.
The therapy uses harmless parts of a virus to deliver a snippet of DNA into cells. When used this way, the virus is a vector or carrier.
That vector delivers DNA — a type of genetic material — to the patient’s own bone marrow cells. That DNA contains the instructions to make a short string of genetic material, called a microRNA. This RNA, Esrick explains, provides new genetic instructions telling those cells to make more fetal hemoglobin.
Her team’s therapy halts production of a protein that normally keeps fetal hemoglobin from being made in anyone who isn’t a baby. Like turning on a faucet, this change means red blood cells can now deliver a steady stream of oxygen-carrying fetal hemoglobin.
Preliminary data show this treatment helped six sickle cell patients make fetal hemoglobin. Esrick and her colleagues described this in January 2021 in the New England Journal of Medicine.
The patients’ symptoms were reduced or went away throughout a follow-up period, which lasted from several months to more than two years. The team has now expanded this trial to include more patients.
Tests of other gene treatments to tackle sickle cell are underway elsewhere. One biotechnology company called bluebird bio is testing an approach that gives patients a normal copy of the hemoglobin gene (to replace their mutant gene). Another team is preparing to begin a trial that will edit that gene directly. It will use CRISPR technology.
Science News staff writer Erin Garcia de Jesús spoke with Esrick about her team’s ongoing trial. Esrick’s answers have been edited here for length and clarity.
What tools do we currently have to treat sickle cell?
The only cure is a bone marrow transplant. The bone marrow is like your body’s blood cell factory. If you can get bone marrow from somebody who doesn’t have sickle cell disease, then you can grow your own healthy red blood cells that don’t sickle.
But getting a transplant is a big deal. And it’s really only standard if you have what’s called a matched sibling. That’s a brother or sister without sickle cell who has key white-blood-cell proteins that match yours.
Fewer than one in every five people with sickle cell disease have such a matched sibling available. Where one is, this becomes a good potential treatment. But it still has risks. There is a small chance a transplant patient may die. There are also a lot of potential side effects. Among them is a chance the body will try to reject the new cells. Or the new cells may react against the body. To limit those risks, people must take drugs to suppress their immune system. But these drugs put patients at a higher risk of infection.
There are also medications to treat sickle cell. The most well-established is called hydroxyurea (Hy-DROX-ee-yu-REE-uh). It increases fetal hemoglobin. In many people, it increases fetal hemoglobin by a lot. That’s why it works so well. It’s been available since the ’90s, and has been moving gradually to use in younger and younger patients.
Today, there is a very clear recommendation that essentially every child with sickle cell should be on it. But not everyone has access to specialists who prescribe this medication. It also has to be taken daily. And there are downsides. Some people have side effects so bad they can’t take it. And the drug doesn’t work in everybody.
How many people are in your team’s trial and what results have you seen so far?
Nine patients have been treated. We anticipate the tenth patient will be treated soon. Early data from the first six patients were published [see above]. Additional data from subsequent patients have been largely quite similar — except for one patient (whose fetal hemoglobin response was not as strong). In a trial this small, it is still too early to draw long-term conclusions.
What is the process like for trial participants?
Patients have to get their cells collected. These are the cells that live in the bone marrow and give rise to blood cells. Getting them takes a three-day hospital stay. Sometimes this collection step has to be repeated a few times. The cells are removed by IV, basically, and then are sent to the lab.
When we get word from the lab that “OK, we have a good product” — meaning the virus got the DNA into enough cells — the patient will come back to the hospital. And they’ll need to stay for a month or so. Because they’ll need to receive chemotherapy, it’s a long and uncomfortable stay.
That chemotherapy is needed to nearly wipe out the old bone marrow cells that weren’t collected and are still in the body. Eliminating them will give less competition to those cells that are given back to the body. This improves their chances to set up shop and expand.
Chemotherapy comes with a lot of side effects and risks. Short-term ones can include temporary hair loss, nausea and pain with swallowing. Chemotherapy brings longer-term risks. These can include infertility and a risk of blood cancers.
Why choose gene therapy over a bone marrow transplant if both require chemotherapy?
With gene therapy, you’re getting back your own cells. So there’s no issue with the immune system trying to reject them. To avoid this risk in people who get a transplant from another person, patients have to be on immunosuppressive medications for months. That is not necessary with gene therapy.
The other risk in a bone marrow transplant from another person is graft-versus-host disease. Here the transplanted tissue and donated cells reject the recipient. That can cause severe disease. With gene therapy, that’s not a risk at all.
Last year, the clinical trial run by bluebird bio announced that one trial participant developed leukemia. Cancer is obviously a huge concern and has thwarted previous gene-therapy trials. What do we know so far about that?
This was, of course, of major concern to the field. It was actually the second case of leukemia in that trial. The first one was published a couple of years ago.
If there’s ever a case of leukemia or any pre-leukemia in a gene-therapy trial, we always ask: Was it caused because the vector stuck a gene into a spot that was dangerous?
It does not look like that was the case here. The first patient in the bluebird bio trial who developed leukemia didn’t have the transferred gene in those leukemia cells. So, the thought was that this was probably a case of chemotherapy causing leukemia. We do know that can be a risk for a very small share of people who get chemotherapy.
But the second case, in February 2021, raised a red flag. Why did that happen two times in a trial of only 40-something patients? It’s still not clear. Some studies have suggested that people with sickle cell disease may have an increased risk of leukemia. While some investigations were done, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration placed that trial on hold. When evidence suggested that this leukemia wasn’t directly related to the vector, FDA allowed the trial to reopen.
Our trial, which has many similarities to the bluebird bio trial, was not put on hold by the FDA. But it was put on hold by our funder, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. After they looked at the data, that hold was recently lifted.
Have there been any cases of leukemia in your team’s trial?
Fortunately, no.
What are some of the biggest challenges that sickle cell has had to overcome?
For the longest time, there were no new therapies at all. These technologies took a long time because they are based on basic science discoveries that were being worked on in labs. But also, the patient population with sickle cell is a population that has historically been underserved and without a lot of power.
In the United States, it’s primarily Black and Latino patients, and those populations have suffered from health inequality. Sadly, I think that if there were a disease that caused this degree of illness, death and pain in other parts of the population, it may have been speedier.
What gives you hope? What do you find exciting?
We have to be careful to avoid sending a message like “We have a cure!” After all, the trials are still small and early. But that said, it is really exciting that because there’s no need to find a bone marrow match, this is a treatment that is theoretically possible for everyone. That’s a huge difference from classic bone marrow transplants.
The speed at which gene therapy treatments are being developed is amazing. I think the horizon is very bright in terms of one or hopefully many of these therapies being really effective and safe.
I’ve talked to so many patients and families who have reached out interested in our trial or other trials. There’s such a huge unmet need."
Science,"Explainer: The body’s immune system
Meet the army of cells that make up the body’s health-protection squad
Your immune system is probably something you ignore, at least until you get ill. Then you realize how important the immune system is. It’s all the various organs, cells and proteins spread throughout the body that protect us from bacteria, viruses and other potentially harmful invaders.
Cells of the immune system can be split into two closely related military squads: innate and adaptive. Troops belonging to the first — innate — patrol the body to detect intruders, such as bacteria and viruses. These troops don’t trust anyone, not even their own body’s cells. But they don’t have to fend off bad guys alone. When faced by a tough adversary, they can call in back-ups — the adaptive troops — that are skilled in even heavy combat.
Naama Geva-Zatorsky works at the Rappaport Technion Integrated Cancer Center in Haifa, Israel. There, she studies microbes and the immune system. The mission of the body’s innate immune system, she explains, is to distinguish between friendly cells (the body’s own cells) and intruders (non-self). Friendlies have specific structures on their surface, like a flag, that the innate troops recognize. They know to ignore these cells. Intruders lack those familiar surface “flags” found on the body’s healthy cells.
When innate troops detect “non-self” structures — such as a virus — they set off alarms. These call out other troops to help eliminate the intruders as quickly as possible. The three most important types of innate troops are immune cells known as neutrophils (NEW-troh-fils), macrophages (MAK-roh-faeges) and dendritic cells.
Neutrophils survey their neighborhood by “tasting” microbes. When they find an intruder, these troops release small signalling molecules called cytokines (SY-toh-kynes). Cytokines quickly recruit help to the developing fight. They tell other immune cells what type of help they need and where to send it. Sometimes neutrophils also change shape. They sprout long arms and form a web-like net to trap invaders.    
Macrophages are bigger, curly-shaped cells that respond to the neutrophil alarms. They hang out in the tissues longer than the neutrophils do. While there, they gobble up as many invaders as possible through a process called phagocytosis (Fag-oh-sy-TOH-sis). Macrophages won’t stop eating until nothing is left. 
Dendritic cells arrive around the same time as macrophages. Dendritic cells digest pieces of microbes and then show them out on their long arms. In this way they recruit a back-up squad into the battle: the adaptive immune system.
The back-up forces
The heavy forces of the adaptive immune system don’t get involved with every little invader. Most of the time, innate immune cells can win the battle by themselves. We don’t even notice it happening. However, when worrisome pathogens invade our bodies, cells of the adaptive immune system take over. They tailor their particular response to each invader but need a few days to make much headway. 
Sometimes intruders sneak into the body and take over some healthy cell. That’s where it will multiply (or replicate). But once inside, that invader is also hidden. The innate cells can no longer find it.
Helper T cells, a type of white blood cell —or lymphocyte — now step in. They collect info on the enemy, regardless of whether those attackers are inside of a cell or out. Then they’ll pass this intel along to another team, the killer T cells.
Killer T cells are another type of lymphocyte. They can kill anything that looks suspicious.
B cells release weapons called antibodies that seek out the enemy. Antibodies, which are families of Y-shaped proteins, are sticky. They glom onto everything that resembles the intruder. In many cases this will be the actual invader. Other times it might be pieces left behind when the intruders are killed. They might even be invader look-alikes created by vaccines. These invader mimics will allow B cells to respond quicker if ever a real microbial invader comes along.
The antibodies tag their target cells so that other immune-system teams can later go in and take them out. Antibodies will also stalk escaping enemies throughout the body. Those antibodies seek out surface patterns on cells or cell bits that identify specific intruders.
After a battle is over, invader-specific B cells remain behind. They form a pool of veterans. They preserve a memory of the former invasion. Based on that living memory, they’ll be able to help the body react faster and better the next time the same type of invader arrives. This process is called immunological memory and it’s the key to how vaccines work.
“When an invader comes in the body, it’s great to have an alert immune system,” says Naama. “But it’s also important that it doesn’t overdo.” There are several ways to stop such an overblown response.
Regulatory T cells, for instance, tamp down the activity of other T cells, before they get out of control. During a skirmish, T cells can get so keyed up that they risk getting out of control. That’s where T-reg squads come in. They help calm down the T-cell combat troops so that the immune system can return to normal.
The immune system helps keep us safe. We can also exploit it against deadly diseases thanks to vaccines and immune-boosting drugs. “The immune system is cool, but we need to keep it healthy,” says Naama. How? Look after yourself. A healthy body means a healthy immune system. "
Science,"Scientists Say: Equation
An equation is math’s way of saying that two groups of numbers or variables have the same value
An equation is a statement in math that says two things are equal. All equations contain an equal sign (=). The set of numbers and/or variables on either side of that sign is called an expression. (Variables are unknown values typically written as letters).
The difference between an expression and an equation is sort of like the difference between a phrase and a sentence. A phrase contains a single idea that is incomplete by itself. A sentence makes a complete statement. Likewise, an expression conveys a single idea — such as “one plus two” (1+2) or “x minus y” (x–y). An equation represents a complete sentence, such as one plus two equals three (1+2=3). Or, x minus y equals z (x–y=z).
Formulas are a special type of equation. They express an important relationship between two or more variables. For instance, the formula A=πr2 shows how the area of a circle (A) is related to its radius (r). (The area equals the constant pi (π) times the radius squared.) Formulas are used to express many rules in geometry and laws of physics. One example is F=ma. That is, force (F) equals mass (m) times acceleration (a).
Equations are not the only kind of “complete sentences” in math. Inequalities also link up expressions to form complete ideas. An inequality says that one expression is bigger or smaller than another. For example, “x is greater than y” (x > y) or “y is less than z” (y < z). But inequalities don’t contain equal signs. So they aren’t equations.

Science,"Scientists Say: Periodic table
This is a chart of the chemical elements arranged by their properties
This is a chart that shows all the known chemical elements. The table is made up of over a hundred squares. Each square represents one element. A square contains one or two letters that stand for the element’s name, and numbers that tell about that element’s properties.
The location of each square in the table tells many things about each element. First, the elements are organized by atomic number, or how many protons they have. Those on top of the chart have the fewest protons. An element’s place also shows how likely it is to react. It also shows how its electrons are arranged.
During the mid-1800s, many chemists looked for patterns that explained how elements interacted. Back then, scientists didn’t know about the protons, neutrons and electrons that make up atoms. But they did understand that elements had different atomic weights.  An atomic weight is the average weight of one atom of an element.
In 1869, the Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev lined up the 63 known elements in order by their atomic weights. He saw trends in the elements’ properties that varied over specific intervals, or periods. Other scientists were working on their own periodic tables, but Mendeleev published his table first.
The periodic table continued to grow as scientists discovered more elements. These include the noble gases, identified in 1890. This is a group of elements such as helium that don’t like to react with other elements. Starting in the 1940s, scientists found many new elements by colliding atoms or pieces of atoms.
At the end of 2018, chemists confirmed four elements that had never been observed before. That brought the number of known elements to 118 and completed the 7th row of the table.

Science,"Explainer: Earth — layer by layer
Sizzling heat, unimaginable pressure and some surprise diamonds: It’s all there, deep beneath us
Mountain ranges tower to the sky. Oceans plummet to impossible depths. Earth’s surface is an amazing place to behold. Yet even the deepest canyon is but a tiny scratch on the planet. To really understand Earth, you need to travel 6,400 kilometers (3,977 miles) beneath our feet.
Starting at the center, Earth is composed of four distinct layers. They are, from deepest to shallowest, the inner core, the outer core, the mantle and the crust. Except for the crust, no one has ever explored these layers in person. In fact, the deepest humans have ever drilled is just over 12 kilometers (7.6 miles). And even that took 20 years!
Still, scientists know a great deal about Earth’s inner structure. They’ve plumbed it by studying how earthquake waves travel through the planet. The speed and behavior of these waves change as they encounter layers of different densities. Scientists —  including Isaac Newton, three centuries ago — have also learned about the core and mantle from calculations of Earth’s total density, gravitational pull and magnetic field.
Here’s a primer on Earth’s layers, starting with a journey to the center of the planet.
The inner core
This solid metal ball has a radius of 1,220 kilometers (758 miles), or about three-quarters that of the moon. It’s located some 6,400 to 5,180 kilometers (4,000 to 3,220 miles) beneath Earth’s surface. Extremely dense, it’s made mostly of iron and nickel. The inner core spins a bit faster than the rest of the planet. It’s also intensely hot: Temperatures sizzle at 5,400° Celsius (9,800° Fahrenheit). That’s almost as hot as the surface of the sun. Pressures here are immense: well over 3 million times greater than on Earth’s surface. Some research suggests there may also be an inner, inner core. It would likely consist almost entirely of iron.
The outer core
This part of the core is also made from iron and nickel, just in liquid form. It sits some 5,180 to 2,880 kilometers (3,220 to 1,790 miles) below the surface. Heated largely by the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium, this liquid churns in huge, turbulent currents. That motion generates electrical currents. They, in turn, generate Earth’s magnetic field. For reasons somehow related to the outer core, Earth’s magnetic field reverses about every 200,000 to 300,000 years. Scientists are still working to understand how that happens.
The mantle
At close to 3,000 kilometers (1,865 miles) thick, this is Earth’s thickest layer. It starts a mere 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) beneath the surface. Made mostly of iron, magnesium and silicon, it is dense, hot and semi-solid (think caramel candy). Like the layer below it, this one also circulates. It just does so far more slowly.
Near its upper edges, somewhere between about 100 and 200 kilometers (62 to 124 miles) underground, the mantle’s temperature reaches the melting point of rock. Indeed, it forms a layer of partially melted rock known as the asthenosphere (As-THEEN-oh-sfeer). Geologists believe this weak, hot, slippery part of the mantle is what Earth’s tectonic plates ride upon and slide across.
Diamonds are tiny pieces of the mantle we can actually touch. Most form at depths above 200 kilometers (124 miles). But rare “super-deep” diamonds may have formed as far down as 700 kilometers (435 miles) below the surface. These crystals are then brought to the surface in volcanic rock known as kimberlite.
The mantle’s outermost zone is relatively cool and rigid. It behaves more like the crust above it. Together, this uppermost part of the mantle layer and the crust are known as the lithosphere.
The crust
Earth’s crust is like the shell of a hard-boiled egg. It is extremely thin, cold and brittle compared to what lies below it. The crust is made of relatively light elements, especially silica, aluminum and oxygen. It’s also highly variable in its thickness. Under the oceans (and Hawaiian Islands), it may be as little as 5 kilometers (3.1 miles) thick. Beneath the continents, the crust may be 30 to 70 kilometers (18.6 to 43.5 miles) thick.
Along with the upper zone of the mantle, the crust is broken into big pieces, like a gigantic jigsaw puzzle. These are known as tectonic plates. These move slowly — at just 3 to 5 centimeters (1.2 to 2 inches) per year. What drives the motion of tectonic plates is still not fully understood. It may be related to heat-driven convection currents in the mantle below. Some scientists think it’s caused by the tug from slabs of crust of different densities, something called “slab pull.” In time, these plates will converge, pull apart or slide past each other. Those actions cause most earthquakes and volcanoes. It’s a slow ride, but it makes for exciting times here on Earth’s surface."
Science,"An atomic clock that could revolutionize space travel just passed its first test
The Deep Space Atomic Clock could help spacecraft reach distant destinations on their own
An atomic clock that could transform deep-space travel has successfully completed its first test run in space.
NASA’s Deep Space Atomic Clock, which launched on a satellite in June 2019, outperformed all other clocks in space during its first year in orbit around Earth. The clock, DSAC for short, was at least 10 times more stable than clocks on GPS satellites, which makes it reliable enough for futuristic space navigation schemes, researchers report online June 30 in Nature.
To navigate the solar system today, space probes listen for signals from antennas on Earth and then bounce those signals back. Ultraprecise, refrigerator-sized atomic clocks on the ground measure that round trip time — which can take hours — to pinpoint a spacecraft’s location.
A future spacecraft carrying a toaster oven–sized DSAC could simply measure how long it takes a signal from Earth to arrive and calculate its own position (SN: 6/21/19). Untethering deep-space navigation from Earth could someday enable self-driving spaceships or GPS-like navigation systems on other planets.
DSAC is so stable because it keeps time using electrically charged atoms, or ions, rather than neutral atoms, says Eric Burt, a physicist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. Bottling ions within electric fields prevents those atoms from bumping into the walls of their container. Such interactions cause the neutral atoms in GPS satellite clocks to lose their rhythm.
By comparing DSAC with the U.S. Naval Observatory’s hydrogen maser “master clock” on the ground, the researchers found that the space clock drifted about 26 picoseconds, or trillionths of a second, over the course of a day (SN: 4/10/19). That’s comparable to ground-based atomic clocks currently used for deep-space navigation, says DSAC principal investigator Todd Ely, also at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory."
Science,"A WWII submarine-hunting device helped prove the theory of plate tectonics
With a boost from World War II, the fluxgate magnetometer became a portable and invaluable tool
This is the story of how the world travels of a 19th century explorer, two bar magnets and the World War II hunt for enemy submarines led to the invention of the portable fluxgate magnetometer. And how that invention, in turn, led to the “magic profile,” a powerful piece of evidence for the theory of plate tectonics.
In the 1950s, the idea that Earth’s continents might be on the move was largely ridiculed, and the seafloor was still mostly a mystery. But that was about to change: In the aftermath of World War II and its naval battles, researchers suddenly had powerful new tools, such as submersibles and sonar systems, to map and probe the seafloor in greater detail than ever before. Among these new technologies was a small, portable device known as a fluxgate magnetometer.
Magnetometers, devices that measure Earth’s magnetic field, were far from a new technology at that point. Scientists had known for centuries that Earth produces its own magnetic field; sailors used compasses to navigate by it. But the strength of that field was puzzlingly inconsistent from place to place.
During his travels around the globe in the early 1800s, the German explorer and geographer Alexander von Humboldt collected measurements of Earth’s magnetic field at different locations, noting that the field’s intensity increased farther from the equator. Those variations led Humboldt in 1831 to initiate a coordinated effort to precisely measure this magnetic intensity around the world. Among others, he enlisted the help of German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss in this effort.
Gauss delivered. In 1833, he reported devising the first magnetometer, which could measure the absolute intensity of Earth’s magnetic field at any location. His magnetometer was deceptively simple, consisting of two bar magnets, one suspended in the air by a fiber and one placed a known distance away. The deflection of the suspended magnet from geomagnetic north depends on both the intensity of Earth’s magnetic field and the pull of the second bar magnet. These measurements succeeded in providing the first global maps of Earth’s magnetic field strength.
But by World War II, the U.S. Navy was looking for even more precise measurements of magnetism. Specifically, the Navy wanted to be able to map very small anomalies in Earth’s magnetic field — anomalies that might be due, for example, to the presence of metallic objects, such as submarines, beneath the surface of the water.
In 1936, scientists designed such a precise sensor, called a fluxgate magnetometer. In a fluxgate magnetometer, instead of a spinning needle like in a compass, a bar of iron is wrapped in two coils of wire. One coil carries an alternating current along the length of the iron core, tinkering with the core’s magnetic state, first saturating it with magnetism and then desaturating it. When in the unsaturated state, the core can pull in an external magnetic field, such as Earth’s. When saturated, the core pushes the external field back out. The second coil is there to detect those changes in magnetism — and along the way can very precisely measure the strength of the external field.
But to use this device to look for submarines, it would have to be portable, able to be mounted on an airplane. That’s where Russian-born geomagnetist Victor Vacquier enters the story. Vacquier was at the Pittsburgh-based Gulf Research Laboratories, an arm of Gulf Oil, where, for several years, he had been hard at work on a portable version of the fluxgate magnetometer.
In 1941, successful tests of Vacquier’s device drew the attention of the Navy, which saw the defense potential of his device. With naval funding, fluxgate magnetometers were airborne by December 1942 and busily hunting for enemy submarines.
After the war, scientists were eager to see what this precise, portable magnetometer could reveal about the seafloor. Oceanographers refitted the device so it could be towed behind research vessels as they swept back and forth across the oceans. During the 1950s and early 1960s, Vacquier (by then at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, Calif.) and other researchers began using the fluxgate magnetometer to measure and map magnetic anomalies preserved in the seafloor rocks.
The maps revealed a curious zebra-stripe pattern of magnetic polarity on the seafloor, something never seen in continental rocks. In this pattern, bands of rocks with normal polarity — the north-south orientation corresponding to that of Earth’s current magnetic field — alternated with bands of reversed polarity. These stripes, scientists hypothesized, might be due to Earth’s magnetic field reversing direction from time to time.
Even more tellingly, the zebra-stripe pattern turned out to be symmetrical on either side of the long, snaking underwater mountain chains known as mid-ocean ridges. That pattern became one of the most powerful lines of evidence for the hypothesis of seafloor spreading, the idea that as Earth’s crust pulls apart at the mid-ocean ridges, magma wells up to form new ocean crust. As the new crust hardens, its iron-bearing minerals align with the current orientation of Earth’s magnetic field, and the hardening rocks become a new stripe in the pattern.  
In 1966, about 100 earth scientists met for what was about to become a seminal moment in the story of plate tectonics. At the meeting, a two-day symposium held at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City, geologists Walter Pitman and James Heirtzler of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., presented a profile of magnetic anomalies they had measured in 1965 from aboard the R/V Eltanin.
The symmetry on either side of the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge was crystal clear, so perfect that it became known as the “magic profile.” This profile, made possible by a series of inventions over the previous century that culminated in a portable, precise magnetometer, became one of the most convincing lines of evidence for seafloor spreading — and ultimately, for the theory of plate tectonics."
Science,"An elusive equation describing bird eggs of all shapes has been found at last
The case of the pear-shaped eggs was toughest to crack
For years, scientists have tried to crack a mathematical mystery: Is there an equation that can perfectly describe each and every bird egg? Variable shell shapes complicated things. But it turns out the answer is simple. A formula using just four easily measured dimensions can calculate the shape of any avian egg, be it round as a ping-pong ball, a smooshed sphere, oblong or a curvaceous pear, researchers report in an upcoming issue of the Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences.
It was that last shape that had eluded the eggs-perts. They found themselves yoked to an equation that couldn’t accurately describe pyriform, or conical, eggs. Previously, researchers developed an equation that accounted for spherical brown hawk owl eggs (SN: 6/22/17), elliptical emu eggs (SN: 10/31/18), ovoid osprey eggs and other similarly shaped eggs.  But that formula didn’t apply to the pear-shaped eggs from birds like great snipes and King penguins.
The new formula needs four inputs: the egg’s length, its maximum breadth, its diameter at the spot where its pointed end terminates and the location of its maximum diameter in relationship to the midpoint of its length. Adding one additional function and incorporating that last diameter variable to existing egg math led to the universal equation.
The finding could have real-life implications, says Darren Griffin, a geneticist at the University of Kent in England, who did the work along with Kent biologist Michael Romanov and Valeriy Narushin, an agricultural engineer formerly at Kent. For example, being able to calculate an egg’s shape could help designers create better padded or form-fitting egg containers, minimizing grocery store waste or that disappointing moment of arriving home with a carton of eggs, opening the lid and finding your eggs cracked. “We’re all supposed to check in the box” before leaving the store, but it’s easy to forget, says Griffin.
The equation could also come in handy in conservation efforts. When reintroducing a bird species, “one of the considerations would be ‘How likely are the eggs to break?’” Griffin says. Knowing an egg’s math could help researchers calculate what parts are most vulnerable to cracking, which in turn could help them assess where and how best to place them in certain habitats to help grow the population in those areas.
The formula’s simplicity “makes this approach practical for field studies” and could even enable researchers to collect the measurements from digital photographs, says Mark Hauber, an ornithologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. “My lab had been working on something like this, but we weren’t able to derive the new math.” His recent work has focused on determining “how birds themselves can tell if an object is naturally egg-shaped or an artificial shape that shares some of the geometry with natural eggs.”
The discovery of the egg equation came while the researchers were exploring how to nondestructively assess the sexes of avian embryos before eggs are incubated. They were looking for physical differences between the attributes of eggs containing female and male embryos, Narushin says. The universal formula is an initial step in “resolving such an enigma.” Now they’re working on a new brood of egg problems, searching for a universal formula for computing the volume and surface area of various eggs, as well as exploring “mathematical shell secrets,” such as why shell thickness differs by species.

Science,"How AI can identify people even in anonymized datasets
Weekly social interactions form unique signatures that make people stand out
How you interact with a crowd may help you stick out from it, at least to artificial intelligence.
When fed information about a target individual’s mobile phone interactions, as well as their contacts’ interactions, AI can correctly pick the target out of more than 40,000 anonymous mobile phone service subscribers more than half the time, researchers report January 25 in Nature Communications. The findings suggest humans socialize in ways that could be used to pick them out of datasets that are supposedly anonymized.
It’s no surprise that people tend to remain within established social circles and that these regular interactions form a stable pattern over time, says Jaideep Srivastava, a computer scientist from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis who was not involved in the study. “But the fact that you can use that pattern to identify the individual, that part is surprising.”
According to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, companies that collect information about people’s daily interactions can share or sell this data without users’ consent. The catch is that the data must be anonymized. Some organizations might assume that they can meet this standard by giving users pseudonyms, says Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye, a computational privacy researcher at Imperial College London. “Our results are showing that this is not true.”
de Montjoye and his colleagues hypothesized that people’s social behavior could be used to pick them out of datasets containing information on anonymous users’ interactions. To test their hypothesis, the researchers taught an artificial neural network — an AI that simulates the neural circuitry of a biological brain — to recognize patterns in users’ weekly social interactions.
For one test, the researchers trained the neural network with data from an unidentified mobile phone service that detailed 43,606 subscribers’ interactions over 14 weeks. This data included each interaction’s date, time, duration, type (call or text), the pseudonyms of the involved parties and who initiated the communication.
Each user’s interaction data were organized into web-shaped data structures consisting of nodes representing the user and their contacts. Strings threaded with interaction data connected the nodes. The AI was shown the interaction web of a known person and then set loose to search the anonymized data for the web that bore the closest resemblance.
The neural network linked just 14.7 percent of individuals to their anonymized selves when it was shown interaction webs containing information about a target’s phone interactions that occurred one week after the latest records in the anonymous dataset. But it identified 52.4 percent of people when given not just information about the target’s interactions but also those of their contacts. When the researchers provided the AI with the target’s and contacts’ interaction data collected 20 weeks after the anonymous dataset, the AI still correctly identified users 24.3 percent of the time, suggesting social behavior remains identifiable for long periods of time.
To see whether the AI could profile social behavior elsewhere, the researchers tested it on a dataset consisting of four weeks of close-proximity data from the mobile phones of 587 anonymous university students, collected by researchers in Copenhagen. This included interaction data consisting of students’ pseudonyms, encounter times and the strength of the received signal, which was indicative of proximity to other students. These metrics are often collected by COVID-19 contact tracing applications. Given a target and their contacts’ interaction data, the AI correctly identified students in the dataset 26.4 percent of the time.
The findings, the researchers note, probably don’t apply to the contact tracing protocols of Google and Apple’s Exposure Notification system, which protects users’ privacy by encrypting all Bluetooth metadata and banning the collection of location data.
de Montjoye says he hopes the research will help policy makers improve strategies to protect users’ identities. Data protection laws allow the sharing of anonymized data to support useful research, he says. “However, what’s essential for this to work is to make sure anonymization actually protects the privacy of individuals.”"
Science,"50 years ago, Arecibo got an unprecedented view of Venus’ surface
Excerpt from the February 12, 1972 issue of Science News  
Venus’ perpetually cloud-shrouded surface remains penetrable only by radio waves. A planetary radar group now reports results of an extended series of radar measurements of the topography of Venus that for the first time provides a view of surface height variations around the entire circumference of the planet.
Those observations were taken by the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico, which was the most powerful radar system for mapping rocky bodies in outer space until its sudden collapse in December 2020 (SN: 12/19/20 & 1/2/21, p. 8). The observatory also revealed ancient lava flows on Venus and ice on Mercury (SN: 9/18/76, p. 181; SN: 11/9/91, p. 295). Arecibo’s maps of Mars and the asteroid Bennu helped NASA plan the Viking and OSIRIS-REx missions. Some other facilities have planetary radar systems, but they are not as powerful as Arecibo’s was. Astronomers are adding a radar transmitter to West Virginia’s Green Bank Telescope that is expected to rival or exceed Arecibo’s."
Science,"Artificial intelligence challenges what it means to be creative
When British artist Harold Cohen met his first computer in 1968, he wondered if the machine might help solve a mystery that had long puzzled him: How can we look at a drawing, a few little scribbles, and see a face? Five years later, he devised a robotic artist called AARON to explore this idea. He equipped it with basic rules for painting and for how body parts are represented in portraiture — and then set it loose making art.
Not far behind was the composer David Cope, who coined the phrase “musical intelligence” to describe his experiments with artificial intelligence–powered composition. Cope once told me that as early as the 1960s, it seemed to him “perfectly logical to do creative things with algorithms” rather than to painstakingly draw by hand every word of a story, note of a musical composition or brush stroke of a painting. He initially tinkered with algorithms on paper, then in 1981 moved to computers to help solve a case of composer’s block.
Cohen and Cope were among a handful of eccentrics pushing computers to go against their nature as cold, calculating things. The still-nascent field of AI had its focus set squarely on solid concepts like reasoning and planning, or on tasks like playing chess and checkers or solving mathematical problems. Most AI researchers balked at the notion of creative machines.
Slowly, however, as Cohen and Cope cranked out a stream of academic papers and books about their work, a field emerged around them: computational creativity. It included the study and development of autonomous creative systems, interactive tools that support human creativity and mathematical approaches to modeling human creativity. In the late 1990s, computational creativity became a formalized area of study with a growing cohort of researchers and eventually its own journal and annual event.
Soon enough — thanks to new techniques rooted in machine learning and artificial neural networks, in which connected computing nodes attempt to mirror the workings of the brain — creative AIs could absorb and internalize real-world data and identify patterns and rules that they could apply to their creations.
Computer scientist Simon Colton, then at Imperial College London and now at Queen Mary University of London and Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, spent much of the 2000s building the Painting Fool. The computer program analyzed the text of news articles and other written works to determine the sentiment and extract keywords. It then combined that analysis with an automated search of the photography website Flickr to help it generate painterly collages in the mood of the original article. Later the Painting Fool learned to paint portraits in real time of people it met through an attached camera, again applying its “mood” to the style of the portrait (or in some cases refusing to paint anything because it was in a bad mood).
Similarly, in the early 2010s, computational creativity turned to gaming. AI researcher and game designer Michael Cook dedicated his Ph.D. thesis and early research associate work at Goldsmiths, University of London to creating ANGELINA — which made simple games based on news articles from The Guardian, combining current affairs text analysis with hard-coded design and programming techniques.
During this era, Colton says, AIs began to look like creative artists in their own right — incorporating elements of creativity such as intentionality, skill, appreciation and imagination. But what followed was a focus on mimicry, along with controversy over what it means to be creative.
New techniques that excelled at classifying data to high degrees of precision through repeated analysis helped AI master existing creative styles. AI could now create works like those of classical composers, famous painters, novelists and more.
One AI-authored painting modeled on thousands of portraits painted between the 14th and 20th centuries sold for $432,500 at auction. In another case, study participants struggled to differentiate the musical phrases of Johann Sebastian Bach from those created by a computer program called Kulitta that had been trained on Bach’s compositions. Even IBM got in on the fun, tasking its Watson AI system with analyzing 9,000 recipes to devise its own cuisine ideas.
But many in the field, as well as onlookers, wondered if these AIs really showed creativity. Though sophisticated in their mimicry, these creative AIs seemed incapable of true innovation because they lacked the capacity to incorporate new influences from their environment. Colton and a colleague described them as requiring “much human intervention, supervision, and highly technical knowledge” in producing creative results. Overall, as composer and computer music researcher Palle Dahlstedt puts it, these AIs converged toward the mean, creating something typical of what is already out there, whereas creativity is supposed to diverge away from the typical.
In order to make the step to true creativity, Dahlstedt suggested, AI “would have to model the causes of the music, the conditions for its coming into being — not the results.”
True creativity is a quest for originality. It is a recombination of disparate ideas in new ways. It is unexpected solutions. It might be music or painting or dance, but also the flash of inspiration that helps lead to advances on the order of light bulbs and airplanes and the periodic table. In the view of many in the computational creativity field, it is not yet attainable by machines.
In just the past few years, creative AIs have expanded into style invention — into authorship that is individualized rather than imitative and that projects meaning and intentionality, even if none exists. For Colton, this element of intentionality — a focus on the process, more so than the final output — is key to achieving creativity. But he wonders whether meaning and authenticity are also essential, as the same poem could lead to vastly different interpretations if the reader knows it was written by a man versus a woman versus a machine.
If an AI lacks the self-awareness to reflect on its actions and experiences, and to communicate its creative intent, then is it truly creative? Or is the creativity still with the author who fed it data and directed it to act?
Ultimately, moving from an attempt at thinking machines to an attempt at creative machines may transform our understanding of ourselves. Seventy years ago Alan Turing — sometimes described as the father of artificial intelligence — devised a test he called “the imitation game” to measure a machine’s intelligence against our own. “Turing’s greatest insight,” writes philosopher of technology Joel Parthemore of the University of Skövde in Sweden, “lie in seeing digital computers as a mirror by which the human mind could consider itself in ways that previously were not possible.”"
Science,"Core memory weavers and Navajo women made the Apollo missions possible
The historic Apollo moon missions are often associated with high-visibility test flights, dazzling launches and spectacular feats of engineering. But intricate, challenging handiwork — comparable to weaving — was just as essential to putting men on the moon. Beyond Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and a handful of other names that we remember were hundreds of thousands of men and women who contributed to Apollo over a decade. Among them: the Navajo women who assembled state-of-the-art integrated circuits for the Apollo Guidance Computer and the women employees of Raytheon who wove the computer’s core memory.
In 1962, when President John F. Kennedy declared that putting Americans on the moon should be the top priority for NASA, computers were large mainframes; they occupied entire rooms. And so one of the most daunting yet crucial challenges was developing a highly stable, reliable and portable computer to control and navigate the spacecraft.
NASA chose to use cutting-edge integrated circuits in the Apollo Guidance Computer. These commercial circuits had been introduced only recently. Also known as microchips, they were revolutionizing electronics and computing, contributing to the gradual miniaturization of computers from mainframes to today’s smartphones. NASA sourced the circuits from the original Silicon Valley start-up, Fairchild Semiconductor. Fairchild was also leading the way in the practice known as outsourcing; the company opened a factory in Hong Kong in the early 1960s, which by 1966 employed 5,000 people, compared with Fairchild’s 3,000 California employees.
At the same time, Fairchild sought low-cost labor within the United States. Lured by tax incentives and the promise of a labor force with almost no other employment options, Fairchild opened a plant in Shiprock, N.M., within the Navajo reservation, in 1965. The Fairchild factory operated until 1975 and employed more than 1,000 individuals at its peak, most of them Navajo women manufacturing integrated circuits.
It was challenging work. Electrical components had to be placed on tiny chips made of a semiconductor such as silicon and connected by wires in precise locations, creating complex and varying patterns of lines and geometric shapes. The Navajo women’s work “was performed using a microscope and required painstaking attention to detail, excellent eyesight, high standards of quality and intense focus,” writes digital media scholar Lisa Nakamura.
In a brochure commemorating the dedication of the Shiprock plant, Fairchild directly compared the assembly of integrated circuits with what the company portrayed as the traditional, feminine, Indigenous craft of rug-weaving. The Shiprock brochure juxtaposed a photo of a microchip with one of a geometric-patterned rug, and another of a woman weaving such a rug. That portrayal, Nakamura argues, reinforced racial and gender stereotypes. The work was dismissed as “women’s work,” depriving the Navajo women of appropriate recognition and commensurate compensation.  Journalists and Fairchild employees also “depict[ed] electronics manufacture as a high-tech version of blanket weaving performed by willing and skillful Indigenous women,” Nakamura notes, yet “the women who performed this labor did so for the same reason that women have performed factory labor for centuries — to survive.”
Far from the Shiprock desert, outside of Boston, women employees at Raytheon assembled the Apollo Guidance Computer’s core memory with a process that in this case directly mimicked weaving. Again, the moon missions demanded a stable and compact way of storing Apollo’s computing instructions. Core memory used metal wires threaded through tiny doughnut-shaped ferrite rings, or “cores,” to represent 1s and 0s. All of this core memory was woven by hand, with women sitting on opposite sides of a panel passing a wire-threaded needle back and forth to create a particular pattern. (In some cases, a woman worked alone, passing the needle through the panel to herself.)
Apollo engineers referred to this process of building memory as the “LOL,” or “Little Old Ladies,” method. Yet this work was so mission critical that it was tested and inspected multiple times. Mary Lou Rogers, who worked on Apollo, recalled, “[Each component] had to be looked at by three of four people before it was stamped off. We had a group of inspectors come in for the federal government to check our work all the time.”
The core memory was also known as rope memory, and those who supervised its development were “rope mothers.” We know a great deal about one rope mother — Margaret Hamilton. She has been recognized with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, among other awards, and is now remembered as the woman who oversaw most of the Apollo software. But her efforts were unrecognized by many at the time. Hamilton recalled, “At the beginning, nobody thought software was that big a deal. But then they began to realize how much they were relying on it…. Astronauts‘ lives were at stake. Our software needed to be ultrareliable and it needed to be able to detect an error and recover from it at any time during the mission. And it all had to fit on the hardware.” Yet, little is known about the thousands of others who performed this mission-critical work of weaving integrated circuits and core memory.
At the time, Fairchild’s representation of the Navajo women’s work as a feminine craft differentiated it from the high-status and masculine work of engineering. As Nakamura has written, the work “came to be understood as affective labor, or a ‘labor of love.’” Similarly, the work performed at Raytheon was described by Eldon Hall, who led the Apollo Guidance Computer’s hardware design, as “tender loving care.” Journalists and even a Raytheon manager presented this work as requiring no thinking and no skill.
Recently, the communications scholar Samantha Shorey, engineer Daniela Rosner, technologist Brock Craft and quilt artist Helen Remick firmly overturned the notion that weaving core memory was a “no-brainer” with their Making Core Memory project. In nine workshops, they invited participants to weave core memory “patches” using metal matrices, beads and conductive threads, showcasing the deep focus and meticulous attention to detail required. The patches were then assembled in an electronic quilt that played aloud accounts from 1960s Apollo engineers and Raytheon managers. The Making Core Memory collaboration challenged the dichotomy of masculine, high-status, well-paid science and engineering cognitive labor versus feminine, low-status, low-paid, manual labor.
A 1975 NASA report that summarized the Apollo missions spoke glowingly of the Apollo computing systems — but mentioned none of the Navajo or Raytheon women. “The performance of the computer was flawless,” the report declared. “Perhaps the most significant accomplishment during Apollo pertaining to guidance, navigation, and control was the demonstration of the versatility and adaptability of the computer software.”
That computer, and that software, relied on the skilled, technical, embodied expertise and labor of thousands of women, including women of color. They were indubitably women of science, and their untold stories call us to reconsider who does science, and what counts as scientific expertise. "
Science,"Keeping the light from fading
Scientists from Nara Institute of Science and Technology created a new approach to compensate for variations in illumination while scanning cathedral stained-glass windows. This work may be applied to other objects of cultural significance to help capture their colors in the most lifelike way.
It's hard to think of a more inspirational experience than watching the sun slowly set through historic stained-glass windows, such as those found in the cathedrals in Europe. While the changing light levels over time may be breathtaking, it also makes high-resolution scans of the windows more challenging. That is, if the scanning process requires minutes or even hours to complete, variations in the natural illumination can lead to inconsistent results.
Now, a team of researchers led by Nara Institute of Science and Technology has developed a new calibration method to help compensate for changes in the sun's illumination over the course of the scan. ""It can take hours to capture thousands of spectral channels pixel by pixel. Thus, the measurement can be significantly affected by the perturbations in natural light,"" first author Takuya Funatomi says.
The researchers set out to capture hyperspectral images of the famous stained-glass windows in the Amiens Cathedral in France. With some window panels dating back to the 13th century, this location which has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A whisk-broom scanner was used to acquire hyperspectral images. This kind of sensor uses a movable mirror to slowly scan across an object. Each pixel is measured one at a time as its light is reflected onto the single detector with the sky in the background. However, when it is applied to outdoor cultural heritages, temporal illumination variations become an issue due to the lengthy measurement time. Hyperspectral scanning is not limited to the wavelengths of light that are visible to humans. For this research, the team used a spectrometer that recorded more than 2,000 channels over a spectrum ranging from about 200 nm to 1100 nm, which includes ultraviolet, visible and infrared colors.
An extra single column scan was added to help calibrate the images. Using matrix methods, variations in temporal illumination could be removed. This allowed for much more accurate results compared with simply normalizing the total brightness, because each color might be impacted differently by the changing light. ""Our method provides a new modality for the digital preservation of large cultural assets,"" senior author Yasuhiro Mukaigawa says. This method can be easily adapted to other situations in which outdoor scanning has to occur over long time periods."
Science,"Quantum information theory: Quantum complexity grows linearly for an exponentially long time
Physicists know about the huge chasm between quantum physics and the theory of gravity. However, in recent decades, theoretical physics has provided some plausible conjecture to bridge this gap and to describe the behaviour of complex quantum many-body systems, for example black holes and wormholes in the universe. Now, a theory group at Freie Universität Berlin and HZB, together with Harvard University, USA, has proven a mathematical conjecture about the behaviour of complexity in such systems, increasing the viability of this bridge. The work is published in Nature Physics.
""We have found a surprisingly simple solution to an important problem in physics,"" says Prof. Jens Eisert, a theoretical physicist at Freie Universität Berlin and HZB. ""Our results provide a solid basis for understanding the physical properties of chaotic quantum systems, from black holes to complex many-body systems,"" Eisert adds.
Using only pen and paper, i.e. purely analytically, the Berlin physicists Jonas Haferkamp, Philippe Faist, Naga Kothakonda and Jens Eisert, together with Nicole Yunger Halpern (Harvard, now Maryland), have succeeded in proving a conjecture that has major implications for complex quantum many-body systems. ""This plays a role, for example, when you want to describe the volume of black holes or even wormholes,"" explains Jonas Haferkamp, PhD student in the team of Eisert and first author of the paper.
Complex quantum many-body systems can be reconstructed by circuits of so-called quantum bits. The question, however, is: how many elementary operations are needed to prepare the desired state? On the surface, it seems that this minimum number of operations -- the complexity of the system -- is always growing. Physicists Adam Brown and Leonard Susskind from Stanford University formulated this intuition as a mathematical conjecture: the quantum complexity of a many-particle system should first grow linearly for astronomically long times and then -- for even longer -- remain in a state of maximum complexity. Their conjecture was motivated by the behaviour of theoretical wormholes, whose volume seems to grow linearly for an eternally long time. In fact, it is further conjectured that complexity and the volume of wormholes are one and the same quantity from two different perspectives. ""This redundancy in description is also called the holographic principle and is an important approach to unifying quantum theory and gravity. Brown and Susskind's conjecture on the growth of complexity can be seen as a plausibility check for ideas around the holographic principle,"" explains Haferkamp.
The group has now shown that the quantum complexity of random circuits indeed increases linearly with time until it saturates at a point in time that is exponential to the system size. Such random circuits are a powerful model for the dynamics of many-body systems. The difficulty in proving the conjecture arises from the fact that it can hardly be ruled out that there are ""shortcuts,"" i.e. random circuits with much lower complexity than expected. ""Our proof is a surprising combination of methods from geometry and those from quantum information theory. This new approach makes it possible to solve the conjecture for the vast majority of systems without having to tackle the notoriously difficult problem for individual states,"" says Haferkamp.
""The work in Nature Physics is a nice highlight of my PhD,"" adds the young physicist, who will take up a position at Harvard University at the end of the year. As a postdoc, he can continue his research there, preferably in the classic way with pen and paper and in exchange with the best minds in theoretical physics."
Science,"Squid skin-inspired cup cozy will keep your hands cool and your coffee hot
n the future, you may have a squid to thank for your coffee staying hot on a cold day. Drawing inspiration from cephalopod skin, engineers at the University of California, Irvine invented an adaptive composite material that can insulate beverage cups, restaurant to-go bags, parcel boxes and even shipping containers.
The innovation is an infrared-reflecting metallized polymer film developed in the laboratory of Alon Gorodetsky, UCI associate professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering. In a paper published today in Nature Sustainability, Gorodetsky and his team members describe a large-area composite material that regulates heat by means of reconfigurable metal structures that can reversibly separate from one another and come back together under different strain levels.
""The metal islands in our composite material are next to one another when the material is relaxed and become separated when the material is stretched, allowing for control of the reflection and transmission of infrared light or heat dissipation,"" said Gorodetsky. ""The mechanism is analogous to chromatophore expansion and contraction in a squid's skin, which alters the reflection and transmission of visible light.""
Chromatophore size changes help squids communicate and camouflage their bodies to evade predators and hide from prey. Gorodetsky said by mimicking this approach, his team has enabled ""tunable thermoregulation"" in their material, which can lead to improved energy efficiency and protect sensitive fingers from hot surfaces.
A key breakthrough of this project was the UCI researchers' development of a cost-effective production method of their composite material at application-relevant quantities. The copper and rubber raw materials start at about a dime per square meter with the costs reduced further by economies of scale, according to the paper. The team's fabrication technique involves depositing a copper film onto a reusable substrate such as aluminum foil and then spraying multiple polymer layers onto the copper film, all of which can be done in nearly any batch size imaginable.
""The combined manufacturing strategy that we have now perfected in our lab is a real game changer,"" said Gorodetsky. ""We have been working with cephalopod-inspired adaptive materials and systems for years but previously have only been able to fabricate them over relatively small areas. Now there is finally a path to making this stuff roll-by-roll in a factory.""
The developed strategy and economies of scale should make it possible for the composite material to be used in a wide range of applications, from the coffee cup cozy up to tents, or in any container in which tunable temperature regulation is desired.
The invention will go easy on the environment due its environmental sustainability, said lead author Mohsin Badshah, a former UCI postdoctoral scholar in chemical and biomolecular engineering. ""The composite material can be recycled in bulk by removing the copper with vinegar and using established commercial methods to repurpose the remaining stretchable polymer,"" he said.
The team conducted universally relatable coffee cup testing in their laboratory on the UCI campus, where they proved they could control the cooling of the coffee. They were able to accurately and theoretically predict and then experimentally confirm the changes in temperature for the beverage-filled cups. The was also able to achieve a 20-fold modulation of infrared radiation transmittance and a 30-fold regulation of thermal fluxes under standardized testing conditions. The stable material even worked well for high levels of mechanical deformation and after repeated mechanical cycling.
""There is an enormous array of applications for this material,"" said Gorodetsky. ""Think of all the perishable goods that have been delivered to people's homes during the pandemic. Any package that Amazon or another company sends that needs to be temperature-controlled can use a lining made from our squid-inspired adaptive composite material. Now that we can make large sheets of it at a time, we have something that can benefit many aspects of our lives.""
Joining Gorodetsky and Badshah on this project were Erica Leung, who recently graduated UCI with a Ph.D. in chemical and biomolecular engineering, and Aleksandra Strzelecka and Panyiming Liu, who are current UCI graduate students. The research was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Advanced Research Projects Agency -- Energy and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research. A provisional patent for the technology and manufacturing process has been applied for."
Science,"Unprecedented videos show RNA switching ‘on’ and ‘off’
Similar to a light switch, RNA switches (called riboswitches) determine which genes turn ""on"" and ""off."" Although this may seem like a simple process, the inner workings of these switches have confounded biologists for decades.
Now researchers led by Northwestern University and the University at Albany discovered one part of RNA smoothly invades and displaces another part of the same RNA, enabling the structure to rapidly and dramatically change shape. Called ""strand displacement,"" this mechanism appears to switch genetic expression from ""on"" to ""off.""
Using a simulation they launched last year, the researchers made this discovery by watching a slow-motion simulation of a riboswitch up close and in action. Affectionately called R2D2 (short for ""reconstructing RNA dynamics from data""), the new simulation models RNA in three dimensions as it binds to a compound, communicates along its length and folds to turn a gene ""on"" or ""off.""
The findings could have potential implications for engineering new RNA-based diagnostics and for designing successful drugs to target RNA to treat illness and disease.
The research is described in a new paper published today (March 28) in the journal Nucleic Acids Research (NAR), which has designated the study as a ""Breakthrough Article."" NAR reserves ""Breakthrough Article"" status for the most high-impact studies answering long-standing questions in nucleic acids research.
""We have found this strand displacement mechanism occurring in other types of RNA molecules, indicating this might be a potential generality of RNA folding,"" said Northwestern's Julius B. Lucks, who co-led the study. ""We are starting to find similarities among different types of RNA molecules, which could eventually lead to RNA design rules for folding and function.""
Lucks is a professor of chemical and biological engineering in Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and a member of the Center for Synthetic Biology and of the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute. He co-led the study with Alan Chen, an associate professor of chemistry at the University at Albany in New York.
R2D2's 'groundbreaking approach'
Although RNA folding takes place in the human body more than 10 quadrillion times per second -- every time a gene is expressed in a cell -- researchers know very little about the process. To help visualize and understand the mysterious yet crucial process, Lucks and Chen unveiled R2D2 last year, in a paper published in the journal Molecular Cell.
Employing a technology platform developed in Lucks' lab, R2D2 captures data related to RNA folding as the RNA is being made. Then, it uses computational tools to mine and organize the data, revealing points where the RNA folds and what happens after it folds. Angela Yu, a former student of Lucks, inputted this data into computer models to generate accurate videos of the folding process.
""What's so groundbreaking about the R2D2 approach…is that it combines experimental data on RNA folding at the nucleotide level with predictive algorithms at the atomic level to simulate RNA folding in ultra-slow motion,"" said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, in his February 2021 blog. ""While other computer simulations have been available for decades, they have lacked much-needed experimental data of this complex folding process to confirm their mathematical modeling.""
Long-distance communication
While Lucks and Chen's previous simulations visualized the folding of an ancient RNA called SRP, the new movies model a riboswitch from Bacillus subtilis, a common bacterium found in soil.
Riboswitches have two basic parts. One part binds to a compound. Then, depending on how the compound is bound, the second part causes the RNA to fold into a shape that allows it to control gene expression. While these two parts are intertwined and overlapping in many riboswitches, the Bacillus subtilis is different.
""What's strange is that they are separated by a long distance, but the bound molecule can cause large functional changes,"" Lucks said. ""If the chemical binds at one end, then how is that communicated downstream to the other end of the RNA? It's been a mystery.""
Lucks, Chen and their teams found the riboswitch likely communicates downstream through the strand displacement mechanism. In response to the chemical binding, the strand exchange process triggers structural switching between ""on"" and ""off"" states.
Optimizing RNA for drugs and diagnostics
With this new understanding, Lucks believes the stage is set for optimizing the riboswitch to perform useful tasks. The switch could be used for synthetic biology-based diagnostics, for example -- engineered to turn ""on"" in the presence of an environmental contaminant. By studying this riboswitch, researchers also will learn lessons that could lead to new approaches to create RNA-targeted drugs or new classes of antibiotics.
""Many diseases are likely caused by something going awry at the RNA level,"" Lucks said. ""The more we know about this, the better we can design RNA targeting drugs and RNA therapeutics.""
The study, ""Cotranscriptional RNA strand exchange underlies the gene regulation mechanism in a purine-sensing transcriptional riboswitch,"" was supported by National Institute of General Medical Sciences (award numbers 5T32GM008382, R35GM13346901 and 1R01GM130901) and the National Science Foundation (award number PHY1914596)."
Science,"Mysterious death of carbon star plays out like six-ring circus
Scientists studying V Hydrae (V Hya) have witnessed the star's mysterious death throes in unprecedented detail. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the team discovered six slowly-expanding rings and two hourglass-shaped structures caused by the high-speed ejection of matter out into space. The results of the study are published in The Astrophysical Journal.
V Hya is a carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star located approximately 1,300 light-years from Earth in the constellation Hydra. More than 90-percent of stars with a mass equal to or greater than the Sun evolve into AGB stars as the fuel required to power nuclear processes is stripped away. Among these millions of stars, V Hya has been of particular interest to scientists due to its so-far unique behaviors and features, including extreme-scale plasma eruptions that happen roughly every 8.5 years and the presence of a nearly invisible companion star that contributes to V Hya's explosive behavior.
""Our study dramatically confirms that the traditional model of how AGB stars die -- through the mass ejection of fuel via a slow, relatively steady, spherical wind over 100,000 years or more -- is at best, incomplete, or at worst, incorrect,"" said Raghvendra Sahai, an astronomer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the principal researcher on the study. ""It is very likely that a close stellar or substellar companion plays a significant role in their deaths, and understanding the physics of binary interactions is both important across astrophysics and one of its greatest challenges. In the case of V Hya, the combination of a nearby and a hypothetical distant companion star is responsible, at least to some degree, for the presence of its six rings, and the high-speed outflows that are causing the star's miraculous death.""
Mark Morris, an astronomer at UCLA and a co-author on the research added, ""V Hydra has been caught in the process of shedding its atmosphere -- ultimately most of its mass -- which is something that most late-stage red giant stars do. Much to our surprise, we have found that the matter, in this case, is being expelled as a series of outflowing rings. This is the first and only time that anybody has seen that the gas being ejected from an AGB star can be flowing out in the form of a series of expanding 'smoke rings.'""
The six rings have expanded outward from V Hya over the course of roughly 2,100 years, adding matter to and driving the growth of a high-density flared and warped disk-like structure around the star. The team has dubbed this structure the DUDE, or Disk Undergoing Dynamical Expansion.
""The end state of stellar evolution -- when stars undergo the transition from being red giants to ending up as white dwarf stellar remnants -- is a complex process that is not well understood,"" said Morris. ""The discovery that this process can involve the ejections of rings of gas, simultaneous with the production of high-speed, intermittent jets of material, brings a new and fascinating wrinkle to our exploration of how stars die.""
Sahai added, ""V Hya is in the brief but critical transition phase that does not last very long, and it is difficult to find stars in this phase, or rather 'catch them in the act. We got lucky and were able to image all of the different mass-loss phenomena in V Hya to better understand how dying stars lose mass at the end of their lives.""
In addition to a full set of expanding rings and a warped disk, V Hya's final act features two hourglass-shaped structures -- and an additional jet-like structure -- that are expanding at high speeds of more than half a million miles per hour (240 km/s). Large hourglass structures have been observed previously in planetary nebulae, including MyCn 18 -- also known as the Engraved Hourglass Nebula -- a young emission nebula located roughly 8,000 light-years from Earth in the southern constellation of Musca, and the more well-known Southern Crab Nebula, an emission nebula located roughly 7,000 light-years from Earth in the southern constellation Centaurus.
Sahai said, ""We first observed the presence of very fast outflows in 1981. Then, in 2022, we found a jet-like flow consisting of compact plasma blobs ejected at high speeds from V Hya. And now, our discovery of wide-angle outflows in V Hya connects the dots, revealing how all these structures can be created during the evolutionary phase that this extra-luminous red giant star is now in.""
Due to both the distance and the density of the dust surrounding the star, studying V Hya required a unique instrument with the power to clearly see matter that is both very far away and also difficult or impossible to detect with most optical telescopes. The team enlisted ALMA's Band 6 (1.23mm) and Band 7 (.85mm) receivers, which revealed the star's multiple rings and outflows in stark clarity.
""The processes taking place at the end stages of low mass stars, and during the AGB phase in particular, have long fascinated astronomers and have been challenging to understand,"" said Joe Pesce, an astronomer and NSF program officer for NRAO/ALMA. ""The capabilities and resolution of ALMA are finally allowing us to witness these events with the extraordinary detail necessary to provide some answers and enhance our understanding of an event that happens to most of the stars in the Universe.""
Sahai added that the incorporation of infrared, optical, and ultraviolet data into the study created a complete multi-wavelength picture of what might be one of the greatest shows in the Milky Way, at least for astronomers. ""Each time we observe V Hya with new observational capabilities, it becomes more and more like a circus, characterized by an even bigger variety of impressive feats. V Hydrae has impressed us with its multiple rings and acts, and because our own Sun may one day experience a similar fate, it has us at rapt attention."""
Science,"On Jupiter's moon Europa, 'chaos terrains' could be shuttling oxygen to ocean
Salt water within the icy shell of Jupiter's moon Europa could be transporting oxygen into an ice-covered ocean of liquid water where it could potentially help sustain alien life, according to a team of researchers led by The University of Texas at Austin.
This theory has been proposed by others, but the researchers put it to the test by building the world's first physics-based computer simulation of the process, with oxygen hitching a ride on salt water under the moon's ""chaos terrains,"" landscapes made up of cracks, ridges and ice blocks that cover a quarter of the icy world.
The results show that not only is the transport possible, but that the amount of oxygen brought into Europa's ocean could be on a par with the quantity of oxygen in Earth's oceans today.
""Our research puts this process into the realm of the possible,"" said lead researcher Marc Hesse, a professor at the UT Jackson School of Geosciences Department of Geological Sciences. ""It provides a solution to what is considered one of the outstanding problems of the habitability of the Europa subsurface ocean.""
The study was recently published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Europa is a top spot to look for alien life because scientists have detected signs of oxygen and water, along with chemicals that could serve as nutrients. However, the moon's ice shell -- which is estimated to be about 15 miles thick -- serves as a barrier between water and oxygen, which is generated by sunlight and charged particles from Jupiter striking the icy surface.
If life as we know it exists in the ocean, there needs to be a way for oxygen to get to it. According to Hesse, the most plausible scenario based on the available evidence is for the oxygen to be carried by salt water, or brine.
Scientists think that chaos terrains form above regions where Europa's ice shell partially melts to form brine, which can mix with oxygen from the surface. The computer model created by the researchers showed what happens to the brine after the formation of the chaos terrain.
The model showed the brine draining in a distinct manner, taking the form of a ""porosity wave"" that causes pores in the ice to momentarily widen -- allowing the brine to pass through before sealing back up. Hesse compares the process to the classic cartoon gag of a bulge of water making its way down a garden hose.
This mode of transport appears to be an effective way to bring oxygen through the ice, with 86% of the oxygen taken up at the surface riding the wave all the way to the ocean. But the available data allows for a wide range of oxygen levels delivered to Europa's ocean over its history -- with estimates ranging by a factor of 10,000.
According to co-author Steven Vance, a research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the supervisor of its Planetary Interiors and Geophysics Group, the highest estimate would make the oxygen levels in Europa's ocean similar to those in Earth's oceans -- which raises hope about the potential for that oxygen to support life in the hidden sea.
""It's enticing to think of some kind of aerobic organisms living just under the ice,"" he said.
Vance said that NASA's upcoming 2024 Europa Clipper mission may help improve estimates for oxygen and other ingredients for life on the icy moon.
Kevin Hand, a scientist focused on Europa research at NASA JPL who was not part of the study, said that the study presents a compelling explanation for oxygen transport on Europa.
""We know that Europa has useful compounds like oxygen on its surface, but do those make it down into the ocean below, where life can use them?"" he said. ""In the work by Hesse and his collaborators, the answer seems to be yes.""
The research was funded by NASA, the National Science Foundation and the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund.
In addition to the Jackson School, Hesse is also a researcher at the UT Center for Planetary Systems Habitability and the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences."
Science,"Researchers map the movement of white dwarfs of the Milky Way
White dwarfs were once normal stars similar to the Sun but then collapsed after exhausting all their fuel. These interstellar remnants have historically been difficult to study. However, a recent study from Lund University in Sweden reveals new information about the movement patterns of these puzzling stars.
White dwarfs have a radius of about 1 percent of the Sun's. They have about the same mass, which means they have an astonishing density of about 1 tonne per cubic centimeter. After billions of years, white dwarfs will cool down to a point where they stop emitting visible light, and turn into so-called black dwarfs.
The first white dwarf that was discovered was 40 Eridani A. It is a bright celestial body 16.2 light-years from Earth, surrounded by a binary system consisting of the white dwarf 40 Eridani B and the red dwarf 40 Eridani C. Ever since it was discovered in 1783, astronomers have tried to learn more about white dwarfs in order to gain a deeper understanding of the evolutionary history of our home galaxy.
In a study published in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, a research team can present new findings about how the collapsed stars move.
""Thanks to observations from the Gaia space telescope, we have for the first time managed to reveal the three-dimensional velocity distribution for the largest catalogue of white dwarfs to date. This gives us a detailedpicture of their velocity structurewith unparalleled detail,"" says Daniel Mikkola, doctoral student in astronomy at Lund University.
Thanks to Gaia, researchers have measured positions and velocities for about 1.5 billion stars. But only recently have they been able to completely focus on the white dwarfs in the Solar neighbourhood.
""We have managed to map the white dwarfs' velocities and movement patterns. Gaia revealed that there are two parallel sequences of white dwarfs when looking at their temperature and brightness. If we study these separately, we can see that they move in different ways, probably as a consequence of them having different masses and lifetimes,"" says Daniel Mikkola.
The results can be used to develop new simulations and models to continue to map the history and development of the Milky Way. Through an increased knowledge of the white dwarfs, the researchers hope to be able to straighten out a number of question marks surrounding the birth of the Milky Way.
""This study is important because we learned more about the closest regions in our galaxy. The results are also interesting because our own star, the Sun, will one day turn into a white dwarf just like 97 percent of all stars in the Milky Way,"" concludes Daniel Mikkola."
Science,"Nearby star could help explain why our Sun didn’t have sunspots for 70 years
The number of sunspots on our Sun typically ebbs and flows in a predictable 11-year cycle, but one unusual 70-year period when sunspots were incredibly rare has mystified scientists for three hundred years. Now a nearby Sun-like star seems to have paused its own cycles and entered a similar period of rare starspots, according to a team of researchers at Penn State. Continuing to observe this star could help explain what happened to our own Sun during this ""Maunder Minimum"" as well as lend insight into the Sun's stellar magnetic activity, which can interfere with satellites and global communications and possibly even affect climate on Earth.
The star -- and a catalog of 5 decades of starspot activity of 58 other Sun-like stars -- is described in a new paper that appears online in the Astronomical Journal.
Starspots appear as a dark spot on a star's surface due to temporary lower temperatures in the area resulting from the star's dynamo -- the process that creates its magnetic field. Astronomers have been documenting changes in starspot frequency on our Sun since they were first observed by Galileo and other astronomers in the 1600s, so there is a good record of its 11-year cycle. The exception is the Maunder Minimum, which lasted from the mid 1600s to early 1700s and has perplexed astronomers ever since.
""We don't really know what caused the Maunder Minimum, and we have been looking to other Sun-like stars to see if they can offer some insight,"" said Anna Baum, an undergraduate at Penn State at the time of the research and first author of the paper. ""We have identified a star that we believe has entered a state similar to the Maunder Minimum. It will be really exciting to continue to observe this star during, and hopefully as it comes out of, this minimum, which could be extremely informative about the Sun's activity three hundred years ago.""
The research team pulled data from multiple sources to stitch together 50 to 60 years of starspot data for 59 stars. This included data from the Mount Wilson Observatory HK Project -- which was designed to study stellar surface activity and ran from 1966 to 1996 -- and from planet searches at Keck Observatory which include this kind of data as part of their ongoing search for exoplanets from 1996 to 2020. The researchers compiled a database of stars that appeared in both sources and that had other readily available information that might help explain starspot activity. The team also made considerable efforts to standardize measurements from the different telescopes to be able to compare them directly and otherwise clean up the data.
The team identified or confirmed that 29 of these stars have starspot cycles by observing at least two full periods of cycles, which often last more than a decade. Some stars did not appear to have cycles at all, which could be because they are rotating too slowly to have a dynamo and are magnetically 'dead' or because they are near the end of their lives. Several of the stars require further study to confirm whether they have a cycle.
""This continuous, more than 50-year time series allows us to see things that we never would have noticed from the 10-year snapshots that we were doing before,"" said Jason Wright, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Penn State and an author of the paper. ""Excitingly, Anna has found a promising star that was cycling for decades but appears to have stopped.""
According to the researchers, the star -- called HD 166620 -- was estimated to have a cycle of about 17 years but has now entered a period of low activity and has shown no signs of starspots since 2003.
""When we first saw this data, we thought it must have been a mistake, that we pulled together data from two different stars or there was a typo in the catalog or the star was misidentified,"" said Jacob Luhn, a graduate student at Penn State when the project began who is now at the University of California, Irvine. ""But we double and triple checked everything. The times of observation were consistent with the coordinates we expected the star to have. And there aren't that many bright stars in the sky that Mount Wilson observed. No matter how many times we checked, we always come to the conclusion that this star has simply stopped cycling.""
The researchers hope to continue studying this star throughout its minimum period and potentially as it comes out of its minimum and begins to cycle once again. This continued observation could provide important information about how the Sun and stars like it generate their magnetic dynamos.
""There's a big debate about what the Maunder Minimum was,"" said Baum, who is now a doctoral student at Lehigh University studying stellar astronomy and asteroseismology . ""Did the Sun's magnetic field basically turn off? Did it lose its dynamo? Or was it still cycling but at a very low level that didn't produce many sunspots? We can't go back in time to take measurements of what it was like, but if we can characterize the magnetic structure and magnetic field strength of this star, we might start to get some answers.""
A better understanding of the surface activity and magnetic field of the Sun could have several important implications. For example, strong stellar activity can disable satellites and global communications, and one particularly strong solar storm disabled a power grid in Quebec in 1989. It has also been suggested that sunspot cycles may have a connection to climate on Earth. Additionally, the researchers said that information from this star could impact our search for planets beyond our solar system.
""Starspots and other forms of surface magnetic activity of stars interfere with our ability to detect the planets around them,"" said Howard Isaacson, a research scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, and an author of the paper. ""Improving our understanding of a star's magnetic activity might help us improve our detection efforts.""
The curated database of the 59 stars and their starspot activity from this research has been made available for researchers to further investigate.
""This research is a great example of cross-generational astronomy, and how we continue to improve our understanding of the universe by building upon the many observations and dedicated research of astronomers that came before us,"" said Wright. ""I looked at starspot data from Mount Wilson and Keck Observatory for my thesis when I was a graduate student, Howard looked at starspot data from the California Planet Survey for his master's thesis, and now Anna has stitched together all the data for a more comprehensive look across the years. We are all excited to continue studying this and other promising stars."""
Science,"Chaos theory provides hints for controlling the weather
Under a project led by the RIKEN Center for Computational Science, researchers have used computer simulations to show that weather phenomena such as sudden downpours could potentially be modified by making small adjustments to certain variables in the weather system. They did this by taking advantage of a system known as a ""butterfly attractor"" in chaos theory, where a system can have one of two states -- like the wings of a butterfly -- and that it switches back and forth between the two states depending on small changes in certain conditions.
While weather predictions have reached levels of high accuracy thanks to methods such as supercomputer-based simulations and data assimilation, where observational data is incorporated into simulations, scientists have long hoped to be able to control the weather. Research in this area has intensified due to climate change, which has led to more extreme weather events such as torrential rain and storms.
There are methods at present for weather modification, but they have had limited success. Seeding the atmosphere to induce rain has been demonstrated, but it is only possible when the atmosphere is already in a state where it might rain. Geoengineering projects have been envisioned, but have not been carried out due to concerns about what unpredicted long-term effects they might have.
As a promising approach, researchers from the RIKEN team have looked to chaos theory to create realistic possibilities for mitigating weather events such as torrential rain. Specifically, they have focused on a phenomenon known as a butterfly attractor, proposed by mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorentz, one of the founders of modern chaos theory. Essentially, this refers to a system that can adopt one of two orbits that look like the wings of a butterfly, but can change the orbits randomly based on small fluctuations in the system.
To perform the work, the RIKEN team ran one weather simulation, to serve as the control of ""nature"" itself, and then ran other simulations, using small variations in a number of variables describing the convection -- how heat moves through the system -- and discovered that small changes in several of the variables together could lead to the system being in a certain state once a certain amount of time elapsed.
According to Takemasa Miyoshi of the RIKEN Center for Computational Science, who led the team, ""This opens the path to research into the controllability of weather and could lead to weather control technology. If realized, this research could help us prevent and mitigate extreme windstorms, such as torrential rains and typhoons, whose risks are increasing with climate change.""
""We have built a new theory and methodology for studying the controllability of weather,"" he continues. ""Based on the observing system simulation experiments used in previous predictability studies, we were able to design an experiment to investigate predictability based on the assumption that the true values (nature) cannot be changed, but rather that we can change the idea of what can be changed (the object to be controlled).""
Looking to the future, he says, ""In this case we used an ideal low-dimensional model to develop a new theory, and in the future we plan to use actual weather models to study the possible controllability of weather.""
The work, published in Nonlinear Processes of Geophysics, was done as part of the Moonshot R&D Millennia program, contributing to the new Moonshot goal #8."
Science,"Design of protein binders from target structure alone
A team of scientists has created a powerful new method for generating protein drugs. Using computers, they designed molecules that can target important proteins in the body, such as the insulin receptor, as well as vulnerable proteins on the surface of viruses. This solves a long-standing challenge in drug development and may lead to new treatments for cancer, diabetes, infection, inflammation, and beyond.
The research, appearing March 24 in the journal Nature, was led by scientists in the laboratory of David Baker, professor of biochemistry at the University of Washington School of Medicine and a recipient of the 2021 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.
""The ability to generate new proteins that bind tightly and specifically to any molecular target that you want is a paradigm shift in drug development and molecular biology more broadly,"" said Baker.
Antibodies are today's most common protein-based drugs. They typically function by binding to a specific molecular target, which then becomes either activated or deactivated. Antibodies can treat a wide range of health disorders, including COVID-19 and cancer, but generating new ones is challenging. Antibodies can also be costly to manufacture.
A team led by two postdoctoral scholars in the Baker lab, Longxing Cao and Brian Coventry, combined recent advances in the field of computational protein design to arrive at a strategy for creating new proteins that bind molecular targets in a manner similar to antibodies. They developed software that can scan a target molecule, identify potential binding sites, generate proteins targeting those sites, and then screen from millions of candidate binding proteins to identify those most likely to function.
The team used the new software to generate high-affinity binding proteins against 12 distinct molecular targets. These targets include important cellular receptors such as TrkA, EGFR, Tie2, and the insulin receptor, as well proteins on the surface of the influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
""When it comes to creating new drugs, there are easy targets and there are hard targets,"" said Cao, who is now an assistant professor at Westlake University. ""In this paper, we show that even very hard targets are amenable to this approach. We were able to make binding proteins to some targets that had no known binding partners or antibodies,""
In total, the team produced over half a million candidate binding proteins for the 12 selected molecular targets. Data collected on this large pool of candidate binding proteins was used to improve the overall method.
""We look forward to seeing how these molecules might be used in a clinical context, and more importantly how this new method of designing protein drugs might lead to even more promising compounds in the future,"" said Coventry.
The research team included scientists from the University of Washington School of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Ghent University, The Scripps Research Institute, and the National Cancer Institute, among other institutions.

Science,"Innovative AI technology aids personalized care for diabetes patients needing complex drug treatment
Hitachi, Ltd., University of Utah Health, and Regenstrief Institute, Inc. today announced the development of an AI method to improve care for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who need complex treatment. One in 10 adults worldwide have been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, but a smaller number require multiple medications to control blood glucose levels and avoid serious complications, such as loss of vision and kidney disease.
For this smaller group of patients, physicians may have limited clinical decision-making experience or evidence-based guidance for choosing drug combinations. The solution is to expand the number of patients to support development of general principles to guide decision-making. Combining patient data from multiple healthcare institutions, however, requires deep expertise in artificial intelligence (AI) and wide-ranging experience in developing machine learning models using sensitive and complex healthcare data.
Hitachi, U of U Health, and Regenstrief researchers partnered to develop and test a new AI method that analyzed electronic health record data across Utah and Indiana and learned generalizable treatment patterns of type 2 diabetes patients with similar characteristics. Those patterns can now be used to help determine an optimal drug regimen for a specific patient.
Some of the results of this study are published in the peer-reviewed medical journal, Journal of Biomedical Informatics, in the article, ""Predicting pharmacotherapeutic outcomes for type 2 diabetes: An evaluation of three approaches to leveraging electronic health record data from multiple sources.""
Hitachi had been working with U of U Health for several years on development of a pharmacotherapy selection system for diabetes treatment. However, the system was not always able to accurately predict more complex and less prevalent treatment patterns because it did not have enough data. In addition, it was not easy to use data from multiple facilities, as it was necessary to account for differences in patient disease states and therapeutic drugs prescribed among facilities and regions. To address these challenges, the project partnered with Regenstrief to enrich the data it was working with.
The new AI method initially groups patients with similar disease states and then analyzes their treatment patterns and clinical outcomes. It then matches the patient of interest to the disease state groups and predicts the range of potential outcomes for the patient depending on various treatment options. The researchers evaluated how well the method worked in predicting successful outcomes given drug regimens administered to patient with diabetes in Utah and Indiana. The algorithm was able to support medication selection for more than 83 percent of patients, even when two or more medications were used together.
In the future, the research team expects to help patients with diabetes who require complex treatment in checking the efficacy of various drug combinations and then, with their doctors, deciding on a treatment plan that is right for them. This will lead not only to better management of diabetes but increased patient engagement, compliance, and quality of life.
The three parties will continue to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of the new AI method and contribute to future patient care through further research in healthcare informatics.
Hitachi will accelerate efforts, including the practical application of this technology through collaboration between its healthcare and IT business divisions and R&D group. GlobalLogic Inc., a Hitachi Group Company and leader in Digital Engineering, is promoting healthcare-related projects in the U.S., will also deepen the collaboration in this field. Through these efforts, the entire Hitachi group will contribute to the health and safety of people."
Science,"Simply printing high-performance perovskite-based transistors
The printing press has contributed immensely to the advancement of humankind by elevating politics, economy, and culture to higher grounds. Today, it goes beyond simply printing books or documents, and is expanding its influence to the realm of cutting-edge technology. Most notably, high-performance components in various smart devices have been successfully printed and have attracted much attention. And now, a technology to print perovskite-based devices -- considered a challenge until now -- has been proposed.
A POSTECH research team led by Professor Yong-Young Noh and Ph.D. candidates Ao Liu and Huihui Zhu (Department of Chemical Engineering), in collaboration with Professor Myung-Gil Kim (School of Advanced Materials Science and Engineering) of Sungkyunkwan University, has improved the performance of a p-type semiconductortransistor using inorganic metal halide perovskite. One of the biggest advantages of the new technology is that it enables solution-processed perovskite transistors to be simply printed as semiconductor-like circuits.
Perovskite-based transistors control the current by combining p-type semiconductors that exhibit hole mobilities with n-type semiconductors. Compared to n-type semiconductors that have been actively studied so far, fabricating high-performance p-type semiconductors has been a challenge.
Many researchers have tried to utilize perovskite in the p-type semiconductor for its excellent electrical conductivity, but its poor electrical performance and reproducibility have hindered commercialization.
To overcome this issue, the researchers used the modified inorganic metal halidecaesium tin triiodide (CsSnI3) to develop the p-type perovskite semiconductor and fabricated the high-performance transistor based on this. This transistor exhibits high hole mobility of 50cm2V-1s-1 and higher and the current ratio of more than 108, and recorded the highest performance among the perovskite semiconductor transistors that have been developed so far.
By making the material into a solution, the researchers succeeded in simply printing the p-type semiconductor transistor as if printing a document. This method is not only convenient but also cost-effective, which can lead to the commercialization of perovskite devices in the future.
""The newly developed semiconductor material and transistor can be widely applicable as logic circuits in high-end displays and in wearable electronic devices, and also be used in stacked electronic circuits and optoelectronic devices by stacking them vertically with silicon semiconductors,"" explained Professor Yong-Young Noh on the significance of the study.
This study was conducted with the support from the Mid-Career Researcher Program, Creative Materials Discovery Program, Next-generation Intelligence-Type Semiconductor Development Program, and the Basic Research Lab Program of the National Research Foundation of Korea, and from Samsung Display Corporation."
Science,"DNA-spiked gel heals the skin wounds of ‘butterfly children’
Topical treatment uses herpes virus to deliver DNA to defective cells
They’re known as butterfly children, people born with skin so fragile that a simple touch can create wounds that may never fully heal. Now, in a small study of patients with the rare inherited disease epidermolysis bullosa (EB), researchers have used a DNA-carrying gel to help mend their skin.
The approach is just one of several new experimental gene therapies for the condition. But it is by far the simplest: A gel loaded with viruses ferrying a therapeutic gene is spread on the skin, like an ointment. Its developers say it is the first topical gene therapy to clear clinical testing, and it is “arguably the most successful [such therapy] to date,” says bioengineer David Schaffer of the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved with the study.
People with EB have mutations that disable genes for proteins that anchor together the layers of skin and the linings of some internal organs. Their skin tears easily, and blisters form in friction-prone areas such as the elbows, knees, and esophagus. Such tearing can result in painful open wounds, persistent infections, scars, skin cancer, and death by early adulthood.
Experimental treatments include skin grafts or stem cells engineered to make the protein missing in a specific form of EB. (Different mutations can give rise to the disease.) In one dramatic 2017 case, lab-grown sheets of stem cells saved the life of a boy who had lost most of his skin. But these treatments require hospital stays and anesthesia, and would likely be unaffordable in many countries.
In the new study, patients had recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB) and lacked a skin protein called collagen VII. To treat their wounds, a team led by Stanford University School of Medicine dermatologist Peter Marinkovich developed a gel containing herpes simplex virus 1–best known for causing cold sores—modified to carry the gene for collagen VII and engineered so that it cannot replicate.
One advantage to herpesvirus is that its genome is roomy enough for collagen VII’s large gene. Another is that the virus has evolved to avoid raising an effective response by the human immune system—the reason most herpes infections never go away. “When you have herpes disease, it’s very troublesome, but as a gene therapy vector it can be quite an advantage,” Marinkovich says. That means that, unlike most viral gene therapies, patients can receive multiple treatments with herpesvirus vectors.
Marinkovich and colleagues first showed treatment with the gel prompted collagen VII production in skin from RDEB patients and mice with the same mutation. In 2018, they launched a clinical trial funded by the company Krystal Biotech Inc. Nine patients, three of them children, had wounds sprinkled with drops of the gel, which was then spread by a bandage. The patients were treated every 1 to 3 days, for 25 days.
In all but one case, wounds healed within 3 months after the treatment ended, the researchers report today in Nature Medicine. One patient’s 5-year-old foot wound needed two cycles of treatment, but ultimately healed for 8 months. By comparison, wounds treated with a placebo gel sometimes healed but reopened. Not every wound treated with the new gel fully healed, but “the results are quite good,” Marinkovich says.
The viral vector doesn’t penetrate far into intact skin, so it can’t prevent blistering altogether. And because collagen VII degrades—and the treated skin cells eventually slough off—the gel has to be reapplied. “It’s not a permanent cure, but it’s a way to really keep on top of the wounds,” Marinkovich says. “It significantly improves patients’ quality of life.”
His team now plans to test the gel on other wounds typical in RDEB patients, in corneas, the esophagus, and around the anus.
The new study is “quite nice,” says stem cell biologist Michele de Luca of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, whose stem cell treatment that saved the boy in 2017 appears to be long-lasting. Given the complexity of his treatment, de Luca suggests the two therapies can be combined, with gel treatments for small wounds, and stem cell or skin grafts for larger areas.
Last week, Marinkovich presented positive results from a larger trial of the gel; Krystal Biotech plans to seek regulatory approval this year. The company is also testing two similar gene therapy treatments: a gel for patients with ichthyosis, a disease that causes dry, scaly skin, and an injection for healthy aging people, to see whether delivering a collagen gene could smooth wrinkles."
Science,"Injectable electrodes could prevent deadly heart arrhythmias
Approach shows promise in pigs, but human trials are still a way off
SAN DIEGO—Heart attacks and strokes triggered by electrical misfiring in the heart are among the biggest killers on the planet. Now, researchers have created a “liquid wire” that, when injected into pig hearts, can guide the organs to a normal rhythm.
The results, presented here this week at a meeting of the American Chemical Society, are “impressive and really cool,” says Thomas Mansell, a biomolecular engineer at Iowa State University who was not involved with the work. “It’s an exciting study,” agrees Usha Tedrow, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Harvard Medical School, also not involved in the work. If the findings translate to people, she says, it could save thousands of lives each year.
“Pacemaker” cells keep the heart in rhythm. Located at the top of the organ, they produce a mild electrical pulse that travels down through the cardiac muscle, causing the heart’s four chambers to pulse in the familiar two-part “lub-dub” beat. After a heart attack or other injury, scar tissue in cardiac muscle can prevent the needed electrical signals from propagating efficiently. The result is often arrhythmias that can either cause the heart to flutter quickly or beat too slowly, conditions that can lead to a stroke or heart attack.
Medications and a procedure known as ablation therapy—in which some of the pacemaker cells are frozen or fried—can help. Other patients must have a defibrillator implanted. If the device detects arrhythmia, it sends a powerful electrical pulse to the top of the heart to shock the muscle back into normal rhythm. It can be painful. “Patients never know when they’ll be shocked,” says Elizabeth Cosgriff-Hernandez, a biomaterials engineer at the University of Texas, Austin. Many wind up with chronic anxiety and depression.
Cardiologists would love to use an electrode that delivers a milder and potentially less painful pulse, not only to the top of the heart, but also to the lower chambers. One option is to thread a thin metal electrode through a coronary vein on the outside of the heart to reach the middle regions of the heart, where it can stimulate the heart’s lower chambers. But the coronary veins of many patients are too narrow or have partial occlusions, making that impossible.
In hopes of getting around this problem, Cosgriff-Hernandez and her colleagues set out to create a liquidlike gel they could inject throughout the length of a coronary vein. The gel would then rapidly harden into a conductive, flexible plastic. (Blood returning through the heart would then flow through other veins.)
To pull this off, the team created a gel from two components: One, called poly(ether urethane diacrylamide) or PEUDAm, eventually forms the plastic; the other, N-acryloyl glycinamide, links the PEUDAm molecules together. When separate, both molecules are liquids.
The researchers then fed both through an ultrathin divided catheter that keeps the liquids separate and inserted the catheter into a coronary vein at the top of the hearts of live pigs. The team pushed the liquids down the vein and its tributaries and removed the catheter. Once the two liquids met inside the vein, the compounds reacted within minutes and hardened into a flexible wire.
“It worked the first time. It was really exciting,” Cosgriff-Hernandez told attendees at the meeting. A bevy of tests showed the wires to be stable, conductive, and nontoxic.
In another round of tests, the scientists scarred some of the heart tissue of the pigs to resemble humans with heart muscle damage. They then injected the liquid wire and, after it hardened, connected it to a traditional battery-powered heart pacemaker. The pacemaker triggered a near-normal heart rhythm. The high-intensity shocks patients receive today can’t match that performance, says team member Mehdi Razavi, a cardiologist at the Texas Heart Institute.
Getting these potentially lifesaving flexible wires into human hearts remains a way off, Cosgriff-Hernandez says. She notes that before that happens, the team needs to test the injectable wires in animal models of heart disease. Tedrow adds that the material will also need to prove stable and safe in long-term studies in animals before human trials can be attempted. But if that proves equally successful, it could be a major win for biomaterials researchers, and patients, she says.  "
Science,"New genetic tricks for boosting crop yield take clues from ancient farmers
A gene that increases the number of grains in both rice and maize could be modified for greater harvests
When farmers in ancient times harvested their crops, some saved the seeds produced by the best performing plants and sowed them the following year. Gradually, this selection led to better and better results, such as increasing the size and number of kernels of maize—traits that helped pave the path to modern corn. Now, a team led by researchers in China has identified a single gene behind this crucial productivity boost in maize and linked it to early improvements in rice harvests as well.
“I’ve never seen anything really like this before,” says Matthew Paul, a plant geneticist at Rothamsted Research, who was not involved with the new study. And the discovery suggests it may be possible to improve other cereal crops, such as wheat, by just changing a single gene. “To find something like this that can move the needle is intriguing,” says Jeff Habben, a plant physiologist with Corteva, a company that breeds new varieties of maize and other crops.
Grain yield is typically controlled by a complex set of many genes, which makes it hard for traditional plant breeders to make more than incremental gains each year. In 2004, maize geneticist and breeder Li Jiangsheng of China Agricultural University (CAU) began to explore the genetics of teosinte, the puny wild ancestor of maize, which early farmers domesticated and bred to create edible corn. One big change: Whereas teosinte has just two rows of kernels, modern maize has more than a dozen. To understand what changed genetically, Li and colleagues spent years creating an experimental intermediate type of maize that has six rows.
By mapping genetic markers, Li and an even larger team identified a gene that influences the number of rows of kernels in this lab-grown corn. They called the gene KRN2, for kernel row number. Two kinds of experiments demonstrated KRN2’s effects. When researchers increased the gene’s activity, plants produced cobs with two fewer rows of kernels. In contrast, when they knocked out, ordisabled, the gene, plants produced cobs with two additional rows. In field tests, knocking out the gene increased the weight of the corn harvest by 10% with no obvious undesirable side effects, the team reports today in Science.
The researchers say their studies suggest ancient maize farmers had, in effect, selected for genetic changes in a region of DNA that puts a brake on KRN2’s activity; those changes eased the brake, thereby increasing kernel rows. And the team discovered ancient rice farmers might also have exploited a similar genetic mechanism. Yang Xiaohong, a molecular biologist at CAU, helped show that a very similar gene, which they call OsKRN2, has the same function in rice, influencing the number of panicles—the small seed-bearing branches. “When we got the results in the fall of 2020, we were excited,” she says. Field tests showed knocking out OsKRN2 boosted rice yields by 8%.
Researchers are still trying to understand exactly how the two genes influence the number of grains in rice or maize. Most of that work involves varieties of rice and maize mainly used for research, but the team has also modified KRN2 in one of the most common varieties of maize planted in China, named Zhengdan958. “That’s where the rubber hits the road, from an industry standpoint,” Habben says. Initial results suggest knocking out the gene adds one extra row of kernels.
Meanwhile, researchers at CAU are trying to modify a version of KRN2 in wheat on the hunch that KRN2 might also boost grain in other cereals. The CAU team is also planning to check whether KRN2 could help increase grain yield in wild relatives of grasses, a first step toward creating new crops that have improved resilience against tougher environmental conditions such as drought or heat.
There might turn out to be many more key crop genes that ancient farmers unknowingly favored—and could now be put to good use by modern plant breeders. In a first step toward identifying them, one author of the new study, molecular breeder Yan Jianbing of Huazhong Agricultural University, looked for signs of selection across the genomes of rice and maize. He and colleagues found 488 genes in addition to KRN2 and OsKRN2 that underwent selection in both grains. Kan Wang, a molecular biologist at Iowa State University, is impressed by the scope of the analysis. “They provide great evidence,” she says. “It’s hard work.”
Many of these genes are involved in starch metabolism, which makes sense because plants fill their seeds with starch. Long ago, farmers likely selected plants carrying those genes to help fill their stomachs with more bountiful harvests of rice and maize."
Science,"War halts project to track wildlife from space
Scientists scramble to find new space-based receivers for animal tags after Russian-managed space station antenna goes silent
The past 2 weeks have been very good—and very bad—for Martin Wikelski and Walter Jetz. In a key proof of principle of their space-based wildlife tracking project, they published a paper tracing the travels of 15 species, including the meanderings of an endangered saiga antelope across Central Asia and the marathon flights of cuckoos from Japan to Papua New Guinea. But the very same week, their data stream from an antenna on the International Space Station (ISS) dried up, likely because data were relayed through a Russian ground station.
The war in Ukraine appears to have grounded their project, the International Cooperation for Animal Research Using Space (ICARUS), just as it was getting off the ground. “This will ruin all the efforts of a great many scientists,” says ecologist Nyambayar Batbayar, director of the Wildlife Science and Conservation Center of Mongolia, whose team has used ICARUS to track snipes and cuckoos. New studies of pinyon jays and robins are on hold because researchers don’t want to burden animals with tags whose data may not be retrievable.
Wikelski, an ornithologist at the University of Konstanz and the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, and Jetz, a Yale University ecologist, say they are now fast-tracking planned efforts to put up other space-based receivers. But scientists who were already skeptical about ICARUS’s goals say its future is in doubt. “I’ve seen a lot of ambitious attempts, but ambition doesn’t always lead to success,” says ecologist Greg Breed of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.
To understand animal behavior and how humans are influencing it, researchers have increasingly put GPS tags on animals and tracked them with hand-held or ground-based receivers. But tagged animals often move out of range, and the tags were expensive, so few individuals could be tracked. ICARUS, founded in 2002, aimed to lift tracking into space and develop cheaper tags, affordable by researchers worldwide. By expanding the number—and sizes—of tagged animals, and tracing their complete journeys, Wikelski and his colleagues hoped to see how both the environment and human influences shape their survival.
It was such a grand vision that Breed and others were skeptical it would come to pass. NASA initially spurned Wikelski’s attempts to collaborate, so he partnered with the German and Russian space agencies; they and the Max Planck Society have funded the project with €30 million to date. In 2019, a German-built antenna was unfurled on the Russian module of the ISS. By the end of last year, scientists had deployed tags on animals at 91 sites around the world, 21 in Russia.
Each time the space station passes over a tagged individual, its tag turns on and uploads stored data. Those data are transmitted to a ground station in Russia and automatically entered into Movebank, a public repository of animal movement information.
The tags have provided new and sometimes surprising insights, Jetz, Wikelski, and colleagues reported on 8 March in Trends in Ecology & Evolution (TREE). The technology traced animals’ entire journeys, not just the end points, yielding clues about why some birds are declining.
Take the mountain plover, a short-grass prairie native about the size of a bluejay, which has declined by 80% since the 1960s. ICARUS data on 17 birds tagged last year showed that when the plovers left their breeding grounds in Colorado, “they all went to different places,” mostly in eastern Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma, says co-author Roland Kays, an ecologist at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Then they moved on to diverse wintering grounds farther south and into Mexico (see map, below). The finding adds to evidence that migrators don’t always head back and forth between two fixed points, but instead follow food and avoid floods, fires, and other disturbances. Data like these are “changing the whole picture of [the] animal migration phenomenon as we know it,” Batbayar says.
The tags revealed some plovers are dying at the midpoint stopovers, says the project’s director, Michael Wunder, a quantitative ecologist at the University of Colorado, Denver. “Once you get [this] ‘where’ you can try to figure out what’s contributing to the mortality” says Georgetown University ecologist Peter Marra.
Ecologists are also enthusiastic about the project’s GPS tags, developed with a company, which at 4 grams and $300 apiece are far lighter and cheaper than most. ICARUS “is making technology available to researchers in countries where we don’t have the means to buy other types of tags” says behavioral ecologist Adriana Maldonado-Chaparro of Del Rosario University in Bogotá, Colombia.
In the TREE paper, Jetz and colleagues propose expanding ICARUS to 100,000 animals that could act as Earth’s “sentinels” in the same way that smartphone data on the movements and speeds of individual cars have revolutionized traffic prediction. Tracking data on seabirds, for example, have shown they alter their courses in anticipation of brewing typhoons.
But shortly after the war in Ukraine began last month, all data downloads from the space station stopped. No one knows exactly why, although Wikelski presumes it’s because the German and Russian space agencies no longer collaborate.
Still, he, Kays, and Jetz remain upbeat. They say the ISS antenna was always intended as a temporary measure and they had already planned to expand the number of space-based receivers by flying them on microsatellites called CubeSats or by piggybacking them on other satellites. Their efforts have yielded tentative promises from space agencies and satellite companies to get receivers back in space by the end of the year, and more by 2024. And in 2027, a joint NASA and German space agency mission to measure gravity variations, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, may carry ICARUS receivers.
For the near term, however, Breed and others think ecologists might do better to pin their hopes on more proven technologies. He and Sara Maxwell, a marine sustainability ecologist at the University of Washington, Bothell, suggest the 20,000 animals around the world now wearing GPS tags retrieved locally or, rarely, with private satellites, can already serve as environmental sentinels. Movebank is developing software to pool those data in the future, Kays says.
Wikelski thinks ICARUS has proved itself. He’s not giving up on getting the big picture of animal movement from space—and vows his project will take flight again."
Science,"Biodiversity: Pressure grows for deal to save nature
A global agreement to reverse the loss of nature and halt extinctions is inching closer, as talks in Geneva enter their final day.
International negotiators are working on the text of a UN framework to safeguard nature ahead of a high-level summit in China later this year.
Observers have slammed the ""snail's pace"" of negotiations and are pressing for a strengthening of ambitions.
Divisions remain, including over financing the plans.
""The science is very clear, we do not have any more time to waste; we need to take action now,"" Bernadette Fischler Hooper, head of international advocacy at WWF-UK, told BBC News.
""Not only on biodiversity loss, but also on climate change which is a very inter-linked issue. So that is what's at stake here; it's actually the future of the planet and its people.""
Biodiversity loss risks 'ecological meltdown'
Biodiversity: Why the nature crisis matters, in five graphics
Five key things about the extinction crisis
The plans call for a fifth of degraded marine ecosystems to be restored
The final version of the draft UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) will be negotiated in Kunming, China, at the Cop15 summit, which is expected to take place at the end of August.
What's needed to save animals and plants from extinction?
The outcome will decide for the coming decades how the world will address the challenges of reducing the extinction risk threatening more than one million species, protecting 30% of land and sea, eliminating billions of dollars of environmentally-damaging government subsidies and restoring degraded ecosystems.
Talks aimed at progressing the nascent agreement have been taking place in Geneva over the past two weeks.
After the first week, observers hit out at what they saw as a ""glacial"" rate of progress, but momentum has gathered during the final days, although ""thorny issues"" remain, including the financing of the plans.
The draft text contains the aim to increase finance to at least US $200bn a year by 2030, with funding from developed to developing countries to increase by at least US $10bn a year.
""Resource mobilisation at this meeting has become a thorny issue,"" Ghanaian academic Alfred Oteng-Yeboah, who has played a key role in international efforts to protect biodiversity, told the news agency, AFP.
The vast majority of lemur species, unique primates found only in Madagascar, are on the brink of extinction
On subsidies, the aim is to ""redirect, reallocate, reform or eliminate incentives harmful for biodiversity"" on the scale of at least US $500bn per year.
The new Global Biodiversity Framework (GBD) is seen as the biodiversity equivalent of the Paris climate agreement. Biodiversity refers to all the different living things on Earth and how they fit together in a delicate web of life that we rely on for food, clean air and water.
One of the key ambitions is to turn 30% of Earth's lands and seas into protected areas by 2030. A recent UN climate report underlined the importance of conserving at least 30% of the planet to achieve biodiversity and climate goals.
Five things new IPCC climate change study tells us
Almost all lemurs face extinction
'Nature's emergency is our emergency too'
Another goal is to ensure that, by 2050, a ""shared vision of living in harmony with nature is fulfilled"".
""We have this one goal, which is to bend the curve on biodiversity loss and really to build that shared future to live in harmony with nature in the long term,"" the convention's executive secretary, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, told reporters at the start of the talks.
Scientists have issued repeated warnings about threats to nature driven by human actions, including chopping down forests and turning natural land over to farming.
A landmark 2019 assessment warned that nature was declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history, with up to one million species facing extinction.
The Cop15 conference in Kunming is expected to take place almost two years later than originally planned due to repeated delays caused by the Covid pandemic.
This has left the world without targets over the course of this decade for halting extinctions and reversing the worldwide loss of nature."
Science,"Scientists claim hairy black holes explain Hawking paradox
Scientists say they have solved one of the biggest paradoxes in science first identified by Prof Stephen Hawking.
He highlighted that black holes behave in a way that puts two fundamental theories at odds with each other.
Black holes are dead stars that have collapsed and have such strong gravity that not even light can escape.
New research claims to have resolved the paradox by showing that black holes have a property which they call ""quantum hair"".
""The problem has been cracked!"" Prof Xavier Calmet of the University of Sussex, told BBC News exclusively, with much satisfaction. He was among those who developed the mathematical techniques they say has solved the paradox.
At the heart of the paradox is a problem which has threatened to undermine two of physics most important theories. Einstein's general theory of relativity says information about what goes into a black hole cannot come out, but quantum mechanics says that is impossible.
Prof Calmet and his colleagues say they have shown that the constituents of the star leave an imprint in the black hole's gravitational field.
The scientists named the imprint ""quantum hair"" because their theory supersedes an earlier idea called the ""no hair theorem"" developed by Prof John Archibald Wheeler of Princeton University in New Jersey in the 1960s.
Prof Stephen Hawking came up with a paradox in the 1970s that suggested either the theory of general relativity or quantum mechanics isn't quite right.
Prof Wheeler came up with the name because it conveys the mathematical description of a black hole: an entity which has mass, spin and charge but is otherwise has no other physical features, bald if you like.
Prof Calmet's ""yes hair theorem"", published in the journal Physical Review Letters is revolutionary. It claims to resolve the Hawking paradox which has deeply troubled physicists ever since Prof Hawking came up with it in the 1970s.
The paradox raised the possibility that either quantum mechanics or general relativity might be flawed, which is a terrifying prospect for theoretical physicists because they are the twin pillars on which most most of our understanding of the Universe rests.
First ever black hole image released
Taking the temperature of black holes
Hawking: Black holes store information
This false colour image suggests that galaxies have a black hole at their centre. But what happens to the material that is sucked into them?
The ""yes hair theorem"" claims to resolve the paradox by bridging the gap between general relativity and quantum mechanics. The notion of quantum hair allows information about what goes into a black hole to come out again without violating any of the important principles of either theory. It is a simple and elegant solution.
""But it is going to take some time for people to accept it,"" says Prof Calmet.
That is because it is such a big deal in the world of theoretical physics.
""Hawking came up with the paradox in the year that I was born,"" says Prof Calmet.
Ever since then, many famous physicists around the world have been working on it, proposing very dramatic things to explain it, including some who had suggested that some aspects of quantum mechanics is wrong.
""So it is going to take a while for people to accept that you don't need a radical solution to crack the issue,"" Prof Calmet said.
If the ""yes hair theorem"" stands up to scrutiny, he said it could be the first step in connecting the theories of relativity - which concern gravity and quantum mechanics which largely focus on the three other forces of nature, which are electromagnetism and two nuclear forces.
""One of the consequences of the Hawking paradox was that general relativity and quantum mechanics was incompatible. What we are finding is that they are very much compatible.""
The research team, which also includes Prof Roberto Casadio of the University of Bologna and Prof Stephen Hsu from Michigan State University, built on the work of Prof Suvrat Raju of the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, in Bengaluru in India.
Prof Raju, with several collaborators, has previously shown that all the information inside a black hole can be recovered from outside as a consequence of the effects of quantum gravity.
""In the past few years, it has been recognized that the no hair theorem fails due to quantum effects and this resolves Hawking's paradox,"" he said."
Science,"Someday soon, smartwatches may know you’re sick before you do
New wearable tech can detect signs of developing illness and put out a warning
We’ve had weather forecasts for decades. Forecasting our near-term health is far tougher. Yet knowing early that we may be coming down with the flu or COVID-19 could be immensely helpful. The good news: Wearable technology, such as smartwatches, is beginning to provide just such early warnings.
Jessilyn Dunn is a biomedical engineer at Duke University in Durham, N.C. She was part of a team that analyzed heart rates and other data from wearable devices. The smartwatch-like systems contain sensors. These collect data — lots and lots of them — that can point to health or disease.
Dunn’s team asked 49 volunteers to wear sensor-laden wristbands before and after they received a cold or flu virus. At least once per second, these wristbands recorded heart rates, body movements, skin temperatures and more. In nine out of every 10 recruits, these data showed signs of developing illness at least a day before symptoms emerged.
The researchers described their findings September 29 in JAMA Network Open.
This early warning, says Dunn, can help nip infections in the bud. It may head off severe symptoms that otherwise would send vulnerable people into hospitals. And knowing you’re sick before you have symptoms can warn you to lay low so you can reduce the chance of spreading your disease.
However, these systems aren’t yet ready for the real world, notes virologist Stacey Schultz-Cherry. She works at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. “This is exciting but also very preliminary,” says Schultz-Cherry. “Much more work is needed before this approach can be rolled out on a larger scale.”
Sifting through mountains of data
The researchers gave 31 of the 49 recruits nose drops with a flu virus. The remaining people were exposed to a common cold virus.
Trials where volunteers agree to receive a virus are unusual, notes Schultz-Cherry. They also can be dangerous. So the researchers made sure the volunteers were healthy and would not give the flu to others. (Doctors also checked in on them frequently during the trial.)
Dunn’s group wanted to compare the sensor data from infected and noninfected people. But deciding who was infected “involved a substantial debate within our team,” notes Emilia Grzesiak. She’s a data scientist who worked on the project while at Duke. The team’s final decision? Recruits were infected if they reported at least five symptoms within five days of receiving the virus. A PCR test also had to detect the virus on at least two of those days.
Recruits started wearing the wristbands before they were exposed. This provided baseline data while the volunteers were healthy. The sensors continued to collect data for several days after the exposure. Some data were measured more than 30 times per second. That means the 49 recruits had up to 19 million data points each, notes Grzesiak. A computer sifted through these mountains of data in search of patterns that signaled emerging disease.
For that sifting, the computer needed an algorithm. Grzesiak developed those step-by-step instructions. Her algorithm tested all possible combinations of sensor data and time points. It looked for the biggest difference between infected and noninfected people. One example of a winning combo: Summing the average heart rate 6 to 7 hours after virus exposure and the average time between heartbeats 7 and 9 hours after exposure. (The actual best model was more complex.)
Grzesiak used some of the data to build a computer model. She tested its predictions in the remainder of the data. Then she repeated this process many times. Her final model accurately predicted infections nine times in every 10.
Challenges ahead
One challenge is that many viral infections have similar symptoms. In fact, many things other than viruses trigger the same symptoms. Examples, Schultz-Cherry notes, include food poisoning, asthma or seasonal allergies. Similarly, heart rates respond to things that have nothing to do with infections. Examples include exercise and scary movies.
What’s more, in real life, we don’t know who was exposed to some virus and when. So that telltale post-exposure time window won’t be known. Potentially infected people might be those whose data exceed a certain value in any two-hour window. But Dunn’s team has not yet tested how well the prediction model would work in this setting.
Could such a system one day point to people coming down with COVID-19? Maybe, says Benjamin Smarr. He’s a bioengineer at the University of California, San Diego. Similar technologies, he notes, are being developed elsewhere to provide early warnings of that infection.
Such studies sound exciting. But much work is left to do. For instance, Smarr notes, prediction accuracies of 95 percent sound good. But that number means “telling one out of every 20 people every night that they will get the flu when they actually won’t.”
Smarr expects continued improvements in prediction accuracies. Future models will likely include other types of bodily changes that pinpoint developing illness. And researchers will be fine-tuning those models by analyzing how well they predict effects in thousands of people."
Science,"Genes point to how some bacteria can gobble up electricity
Researchers hope to harness this microbial superpower to store energy or make biofuels
Bacteria can have superpowers. Some flourish in almost any environment. Others can transform toxic materials into harmless sludge. A bacterium called Shewanella oneidensis can do both. But this microbe also has a much rarer superpower: It absorbs and produces electricity. In fact, new research suggests, these bacteria may be able to use energy collected from wind or solar sources to make fuels to run vehicles and more.
“I think of these organisms as eating electricity,” says Annette Rowe. She’s a microbiologist at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio. Her team has just identified which genes the microbe uses to gobble electricity.
Electrons are negatively charged particles. A moving stream of them creates an electric current. Scientists already knew that Shewanella can move electrons back and forth across its cell wall. But they didn’t know exactly how the microbes controlled their current, Rowe says.
“The pathway for getting the electrons in and out of the cell is like a wire,” says Rowe. “It allows current to flow from the inside to the outside.” Reverse the flow, she says, and “you can drive electrons into the cell.” The cell could then use those electrons to do some other job, such as generate current. Or it could store the energy to use later. Those electrons could later be used to make fuel, for example.
Rowe knew that Shewanella’s cellular “wire” had to be controlled by genes. But which ones?
Buz Barstow was able to help. He is a biological engineer at Cornell University. It’s in Ithaca, N.Y. Earlier, he had made a list of nearly 4,000 of this bacterium’s genes. That list also included mutations, or changes, in those genes. Rowe tested these mutants to find the genes that made up Shewanella’s cellular “wire.”
Within a cell, a gene can deleted. For the new study, Rowe and her colleagues tested groups of bacteria with groups of deleted genes. Their goal: to see which deleted genes allowed the bacteria to pull in electrons. These were likely genes involved in making the cell’s “wire.”
That was no easy task. “It was really tricky to look for electron flow” and track the electrons, she says. But in time they devised a clever test. They grew the different mutated bacteria on glass covered by a thin metal film. Then they attached a wire to the bacteria. When they sent an electric current through the wire, they could measure how much the bacteria absorbed or added. If electrons didn’t flow, the scientists knew the deleted genes must have been the ones needed for electron flow. 
In time, they narrowed in on five such genes that Shewanella apparently uses to absorb electrons. Each gene tells the cell how to make a protein. Some of those proteins likely “grab” electrons and bring them into the cell. Others may send signals within the cell that guide the process. Still others can likely expel electrons from the cell.
Scientists see many ways to use electric microbes. One would be to make biofuels. These differ from fossil fuels, such as coal and natural gas. (Fossil fuels are rich in carbon from decayed remains of ancient living things.) Ethanol, which can be made from corn or sugarcane, is a biofuel that can be added to standard gasoline. Cars that run on diesel can be adapted to run on another biofuel. Called biodiesel, it is fuel made from vegetable oil or animal fats.
Biofuels get their carbon from sources like plants or animal wastes. One day, they may even get their carbon with the help of bacteria, says Rowe.
Shewanella is among bacteria thatcan pluck carbon atoms out of carbon dioxide. They can use it to create other, larger molecules that could be burned as a biofuel. And powered by the electrons it gobbles, Shewanella could keep making these molecules, Rowe says.
Knowing which genes drive the electron-eating could help scientists develop new biofuels, says Rowe. Even better would be if the electrons that “feed” the bacteria come from wind or solar power. Such sources could power the biofuel-making process without adding warming carbon dioxide to the air.
Elad Noor is an environmental scientist. He works at the Weizmann Institute of Science. It’s in Rehovot, Israel. There, he’s helping to develop new ways to “fix” carbon — that is, to pull carbon from carbon dioxide to build other chemical compounds. Using bacteria to create biofuels is attractive because the bacteria can regenerate and should be able to repurpose the carbon. Soring energy in bacteria also would be green, he adds. After all, the microbes don’t need dangerous metals, as a normal battery would.
However, working with living organisms is complicated, he warns. “Biological systems are hard to predict,” he says. “There are ways to store energy that are much more efficient.”
The genes that Rowe’s team found in Shewanella show up in other bacteria. The group plans to search for others that can store or release electrons. Rowe also wants to try to improve Shewanella’s abilities, because these “are the organisms we know the most about.”"
Science,"Scientists Say: Silicon
Silicon is one of the most abundant — and useful — elements on Earth
Silicon is a chemical element on the periodic table. It has an atomic number of 14, meaning it contains 14 protons. With properties between those of metals and non-metals, silicon is a “metalloid.” Its name comes from the Latin word “silex” or “silicis,” which means “flint.” Indeed, silicon is a key element in the rock flint.
Silicon is found in many rocks. It makes up more than 25 percent of Earth’s crust. In fact, it is the second most common element in the crust after oxygen. In nature, silicon is not usually found by itself. Instead, it is often paired with oxygen to form silica, or with oxygen and other elements to form silicates. Silica is found in sand, quartz and flint. Silicate minerals include granite, mica and feldspar.
Silicon is one of the most useful elements on Earth. For instance, it is a key ingredient of silicone. Silicone is a type of material used to make medical tools, cookware, adhesives and more. But silicon’s main claim to fame is modern electronics, such as phones and computers. In those devices, silicon acts as a semiconductor. That is a material that can transfer electricity at some times but not others. This allows silicon parts to act like tiny electrical on/off switches. Their “on” and “off” states encode the 1s and 0s of digital computer data. Without them, you would not be reading these words on a screen right now. That’s why the major hub of tech companies near San Francisco, Calif., is nicknamed “Silicon Valley.”

Science,"Explainer: Calculating a star’s age
This is one thing best left to the professionals, because it’s not as easy as you think
Scientists know quite a lot about stars. After centuries of pointing telescopes at the night sky, astronomers and amateurs alike can figure out key traits of any star, such as its mass or its composition.
To calculate a star’s mass, just look at the time it takes to orbit a companion star (if it has one). Then do a bit of algebra. To determine what it’s made of, look to the spectrum of light the star emits. But the one aspect scientists haven’t quite cracked yet is time.
“The sun is the only star we know the age of,” says astronomer David Soderblom. He works at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Md. We use what we know about it and how it compares to others, he says, to figure out the age of other stars.
Even well-studied stars surprise scientists every now and then. In 2019, the red supergiant Betelgeuse dimmed. At the time, astronomers weren’t sure if this star was just going through a phase. The alternative was more exciting: It might be poised to explode as a supernova. (Turns out it was just a phase.) The sun also shook things up when scientists noticed that it wasn’t behaving like other middle-aged stars. It’s not as magnetically active as other stars of its age and mass. That suggests astronomers still might not fully understand the timeline of middle age.
Using physics and indirect measurements, scientists can make a ballpark estimate of a star’s age. Some methods, it turns out, work better for different types of stars.
Why do we even care? Galaxies are huge collections of stars of different ages. Star ages might help us figure out how such galaxies grow and evolve or how planets within them form. Knowing star ages might even assist in the search for life in other solar systems.
H-R diagrams
Scientists have a pretty good idea of how stars are born, how they live and how they die. For instance, young stars start burning through their hydrogen fuel. When that fuel is largely gone, they puff up. Eventually they’ll spray their gases into space — sometimes with a bang, other times with a whimper.
But when exactly each stage of a star’s life cycle occurs is where things get complicated. Depending on their mass, certain stars hit their age milestones after a different number of years. More massive stars die young. Less massive ones can burn steadily for billions of years.
At the turn of the 20th century, two astronomers — Ejnar Hertzsprung and Henry Norris Russell — independently came up with an idea of how to chart stars to categorize them. They plotted each star’s temperature against its brightness. The patterns they made when charted together became known as Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams. And these patterns corresponded to where different stars were in their life cycle. Today, scientists use these patterns to determine the age of star clusters, whose stars are thought to have all formed at the same time.
One problem: Unless you do a lot of math and modeling, this method can be used only for stars in clusters. Or it can be used to compare a single star’s color and brightness with theoretical H-R diagrams. “It’s not very precise,” says astronomer Travis Metcalfe of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
Unfortunately he adds, “It’s the best thing we’ve got.”"
Science,"More than 9,000 tree species may be waiting to be discovered
Many of them are probably rare and hiding out in South America
Earth is home to a lot more types of trees than once thought.
Our planet hosts about 64,100 known tree species. Another 9,200 or more species might also exist, scientists now estimate. These just haven’t been found yet. If true, this would bring the total number of tree species on Earth to about 73,300.
To reach this new estimate, researchers analyzed global forest data. They used statistics to calculate how many species might exist. Then, they subtracted the number of species known to science. This gave them an estimate of how many novel species may still await discovery.
Roberto Cazzolla Gatti is a biologist at the University of Bologna in Italy. He and his team reported their findings February 8 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
More than a third of the unseen species may live in the Amazon region of South America. Any undiscovered trees there are likely rare, says Cazzolla Gatti.
His team’s new findings could help focus efforts to preserve the Amazon. Fires and logging are quickly erasing its habitat. Many plants and animals may be wiped off the map before they can be discovered.
Without biodiversity, Cazzolla Gatti argues, “we have not many chances to keep our planet alive.”"
Science,"Patterns in brain activity can identify who will struggle to read
Those diagnostic patterns show up even while doing math problems, a new study finds
Reading involves several different areas of the brain. A new study finds that connections between these regions can predict how well someone reads. Surprisingly, new data show that the connections that develop while doing mental math computations also predict reading ability.
Chris McNorgan works at the University at Buffalo in New York. As a cognitive neuroscientist, he studies how brain regions interact while we do various tasks. For the new study, he looked at which parts of the brain link up as we read. “Reading involves connecting words that you see on a page with sounds that you hear in your head,” he says. That requires connections between the systems that process vision and hearing, he explains. But making those connections doesn’t come easily for all.
People with dyslexia, for instance, often struggle with reading. This learning disorder makes it hard for the brain to link written letters or numbers to the sounds they represent. The condition does not reflect intelligence. Even bright people who suffer from it may confuse the order of letters and sounds such that they mix up words or their spelling. McNorgan wanted to know what brain connections were behind this.
Investigating links between brain regions is hard. “The whole brain is always doing something,” McNorgan says. As it works, the brain briefly connects different regions. Some links form while thinking. Others connect while reading. Still others form while listening to a teacher or watching a video.
As we mentally shift from one thing to another, some connections break as others form. McNorgan used computers to hunt those links down. He used artificial intelligence systems known as machine learning models. People train them using large data sets. The models learn which features within the data point to something of interest. Here, McNorgan wanted to find out which connections predicted reading ability.
McNorgan trained his model using data from another lab. Those data came from kids ages 8 to 13 as they read a real word or fake word while lying in an MRI machine. That machine scanned their brains to show which areas were active as they read. McNorgan identified the strongest and weakest readers from the group based on test scores. He then used those students’ brain scans to train his machine-learning model.
It found one set of connections in the brains of strong readers. A different set emerged in the brains of kids with dyslexia. Strong readers used the left side of their brains when reading. That’s the side associated with language, McNorgan explains.
“We don’t know why,” he says, but readers who struggled made more use of the brain’s right side. McNorgan says the brain of poor readers may use this side to compensate — “to help get up to speed.”
Surprising link
It’s possible a model will work for one set of data and not another, McNorgan explains. If that happens, it can suggest any signal seen with the training data may just be due to noise. That’s why after training a machine-learning model, researchers test it with a new set of data.
To test his model, McNorgan turned to a second study from the MRI lab. It had asked students do simple multiplication problems in their heads. The same kids also performed some reading tasks. McNorgan used scans for these kids to see if his model could predict which were strong or weak readers.
On a whim, he also decided to test the model with the scans made when the students had been multiplying numbers instead of reading. He didn’t expect the model to find anything. After all, math and reading are very different skills. To his surprise, however, the model identified strong and weak readers with almost perfect accuracy.
“Whatever is going on in that reading network also is showing up while they’re doing another task,” McNorgan now reports. It’s hard to say exactly what strong and weak readers are doing differently when they do multiplication in their head, he notes.
He reported his findings February 12 in Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience.
More questions
Although the brain uses some of the same connections in reading and math, this doesn’t mean someone is going to be good — or bad — at both. “Being a good reader and being good at math are disconnected,” he says. “In fact, you can be a poor reader and be fantastic at math.” But in kids who struggle with both reading and math, McNorgan hopes his research will be the first step in helping to understand why.
Marc Joanisse finds the new study on brain linkages “a unique step forward in how we think about brain differences in children with learning disabilities.” Joanisse, who was not involved with the study, is a psychologist at the University of Western Ontario in Canada. The new findings show that learning disabilities are much less specific than we usually assume, he notes.
“The technique has tremendous promise,” Joanisse says. It can be used to better understand “many different aspects of how the brain works.” He says it may even identify the source of disorders in the brain."
Sports,"Manchester United: Erik ten Hag needs 'football club, not commercial club' - Louis van Gaal
Former Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has suggested Erik ten Hag should rule out a move to the Red Devils because they are ""a commercial club"".
United have spoken to Ajax coach Ten Hag about their vacant manager's job.
Interim boss Ralf Rangnick, who replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, will be in charge until the summer.
""I'm not going to advise [Erik], he'll call me himself. But he must choose a football club and not a commercial club,"" said Netherlands boss Van Gaal.
Ten Hag, 52, has a contract with the reigning Dutch champions until 2023.
However, that is unlikely to prove an obstacle should United decide the Dutchman - who led Ajax to league titles in 2019 and 2021, plus the 2019 Champions League semi-finals - is the right man to replace Rangnick.
Paris St-Germain boss Mauricio Pochettino is also on a shortlist, with Sevilla coach Julen Lopetegui and Spain coach Luis Enrique also in the frame.
But Van Gaal, who won the FA Cup during his spell in charge at Old Trafford between 2014 and 2016, suggested Ten Hag should consider his options carefully.
""Erik ten Hag is a great coach and that is always good for Manchester United,"" added Van Gaal, who was speaking before the Netherlands' friendly against Germany.
""But Manchester United are a commercial club, so it's a difficult choice for a coach. He'd better go to a football club."""
Sports,"João Carvalhaes: Football's psychology pioneer and his role in 1958 World Cup win
In the summer of 1958 a 17-year-old Brazilian took international football by storm.
Six goals in four games. A hat-trick in the semi-final. Two more in the final as Brazil claimed the trophy they so desperately craved.
Arriving in Sweden for the World Cup as an unknown, Pelé left as a star who would go on to achieve sporting immortality. But one man within the Brazil camp had argued against him playing.
Professor João Carvalhaes was the team's psychologist. In stark contrast to his modern-day counterparts, whose remit tends to be strictly focused on supporting players' performance and mental health, he had real influence over selection.
Pelé's results in the psychometric tests Carvalhaes applied was the reason for his somewhat dubious advice, which was ignored in this instance. The legendary footballer himself later said of Carvalhaes' methods: ""They were either ahead of their time for football or just odd, or maybe both.""
But beyond doubt is his place in history as a sporting pioneer. Carvalhaes introduced psychology laboratories to South American football almost 30 years before the concept was adopted in Europe.
Back in 1950s Brazil, they wanted all the help they could get.
Brazil's 1950 and 1954 World Cup campaigns had been torturous. In 1950 defeat in the final by Uruguay at the Maracanã, the spiritual home of Brazilian football, prompted mourning across the country.
The 1954 tournament, held in Switzerland, ended in ignominy as Brazil were reduced to nine men during an ugly 4-2 quarter-final loss to Hungary in a match nicknamed 'The Battle of Berne'.
While the national team attempted to move on from the emotional trauma, a little-known psychologist was making his entrance into Brazilian domestic football.
Carvalhaes joined São Paulo in 1957, leaving a job training referees for the city's football federation. The club's interest was piqued by the psychology laboratory he had founded, the likes of which would not be seen in Europe until AC Milan's 'Mind Room' of the late 1980s.
The lab was built at the federation's headquarters and housed 10 tests examining cognitive functions such as stereoscopic vision (depth perception). Carvalhaes used the tests to help highlight the skills trainee referees needed to hone before qualifying to officiate professional matches.
Carvalhaes set thresholds for each variable he monitored, with candidates scoring below a particular benchmark considered unable to referee. For example, participants who recorded a result slower than 50 hundredths of a second during the 'reaction time test' fell into this category.
He combined his day job with regular evening stints as a boxing commentator and journalist, during which he adopted the pseudonym João do Ringue (Joao of the Ring). In contrast to his ringside persona, though, Carvalhaes' touchline demeanour was reflective, according to former colleague Dr José Glauco Bardella.
""Arriving at the training ground, you could see everyone excited, but João would be in the corner, quiet, hands in his pockets, just observing,"" he told a 2000 documentary on Carvalhaes' work, made by the São Paulo Regional Council of Psychology.
Carvalhaes may have been watchful, but he was far from a mere spectator.
After São Paulo won the Campeonato Paulista in 1957, the team's first state championship since 1953, Carvalhaes was heralded for his role in a selection decision that proved key to victory.
Club director Manoel Raimundo Paes de Almeida said the replacement of regular midfielder Ademar with fellow playmaker Sarara, who then shone in a crunch match with Corinthians, was based on Carvalhaes' concerns about Ademar's state of mind.
A year later the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) came calling. Vice-president Paulo Machado de Carvalho, the man charged with planning for the forthcoming World Cup, asked Carvalhaes to join the team's technical committee. It was an offer too good to turn down.
Pele leans in to goalkeeper Gilmar as Brazil celebrate beating Sweden 5-2 in the 1958 World Cup final
Brazil's preparations were already under way and Carvalhaes wasted little time in implementing the methods he had employed at São Paulo. During the squad's pre-tournament camp he conducted an 'Army Alpha' test - an adaptation of an American programme designed to assess the intellectual capability of World War One recruits.
The 50-minute exam examined players' arithmetic ability and vocabulary, with the intention of assigning an 'intelligence rating'. Those deemed less capable were asked to take an 'Army Beta' test involving exercises such as completing half-drawn pictures and tracing paths through two-dimensional mazes.
While the concepts behind the tests might seem dated in comparison to contemporary psychology theory, they pushed the boundaries of thinking at the time, particularly in a sport that had seen very little, if anything, in the way of psychology-focused interventions.
Carvalhaes was asked to present his findings to the CBF technical committee. The results, much to his consternation, were leaked to the Brazilian media. In a letter to de Carvalho, Carvalhaes alleged that documents were stolen from his briefcase.
The leak led to suggestions that star player Garrincha, whose test results were poor, would fail to make the cut for the World Cup. Carvalhaes was exasperated. The public fallout ran counter to his behind-the-scenes way of working.
But the storm was short-lived. After Garrincha was named in Brazil's squad, media speculation died down and Carvalhaes travelled to Sweden with the rest of the backroom staff. He continued working with the players, using Myokinetic Psychodiagnosis (MKP) tests to analyse individual characteristics and tailor his support accordingly.
The MKP tests, in which players were given a blank sheet of paper and asked to draw whatever came to mind, were based on the theory that expressive muscle movements can help to indicate an individual's temperament.
Once again, Carvalhaes was applying techniques that had never been used at this level of the game. Once again, he ran into trouble.
Carvalhaes retired in 1974 and died only two years later
""As part of our preparations the team psychologist, Professor João Carvalhaes, had conducted tests on all the players,"" writes Pelé in his autobiography, 'Pelé'.
""We had to draw sketches of people and answer questions to help João make assessments about whether we should be picked or not.
""About me he concluded that I should not be selected: 'Pelé is obviously infantile. He lacks the necessary fighting spirit.' He also advised against Garrincha, who was not seen as responsible enough.
""Fortunately for me and for Garrincha, Vicente Feola (Brazil's manager) was always guided by his instincts, and he just nodded gravely at the psychologist, saying: 'You may be right. The thing is you don't know anything about football. If Pelé's knee is ready, he plays.'""
Carvalhaes' work had 'a far-sightedness you can see in the roots of today's sports science'
Others were more positive in their assessment.
Goalkeeper Gilmar, also interviewed for the 2000 documentary on Carvalhaes' work, said he ""gave us the chance to take on ideas that could improve our performance"", adding: ""After the tournament, we realised that it worked.""
Defender Nilson Santos said the team learned to ""enter the pitch smiling"" and Brazilian radio reports filed after the World Cup victory spoke of a ""consensus about the importance"" of Carvalhaes' role.
Unfortunately, the CBF was less forthcoming in commending him, a stance that took an emotional toll on a reflective individual.
""He was very upset because de Carvalho made inappropriate comments about his work and it saddened him a lot,"" said Barella.
But he was beginning to attract wider attention. According to Barella, Carvalhaes received interview invitations from magazines in Spain, France and Germany, while Sports Illustrated also highlighted his contribution to the Brazil team.
The international recognition helped to quell Carvalhaes' frustration. It perhaps also paved the way for future leading practitioners, such as Dr Bruno Demichelis, AC Milan's venerated former sport scientist, to advance the use of psychology in elite football.
 
Carvalhaes died in 1976 at the age of 58, just two years after retiring. He had returned to São Paulo after the 1958 World Cup, stepping down from his national team position to reprise his role at the club that helped make his name.
Back in the relative sanctuary of domestic football, Carvalhaes was able to introduce new ideas such as individual counselling sessions for players, to supplement the cognitive testing for which he was renowned.
He continued to work for São Paulo until 1974, aside from a brief return to boxing in 1963, when he provided psychological support for Brazilian fighters competing in the Pan American Games.
While Coleman Griffith (1893-1966) is widely recognised as the first sports psychologist, his work was largely confined to American football. Carvalhaes was implementing methods never before seen in top-level football, and doing so with some success.
If he played a role in laying the groundwork for contemporary sports psychology, the CBF - perhaps by dint of a willingness to consider all options in its bid to win the World Cup - also lent a helping hand.
Without the risk they took in appointing a psychologist, who had only been employed by São Paulo for a single season before joining the national team, it is probable that Carvalhaes' work would not have been as widely acknowledged as it was.
But even today, embedding psychologists within training ground environments - beyond academy level, where many English clubs are mandated to provide psychological support for players - remains far from commonplace.
""Psychology is accepted to various degrees within football clubs,"" says Simon Clifford, who led Southampton's sports science department in the early 2000s.
""Some will have psychologists working closely with first-team players, others will have managers who see themselves as the main psychologist and don't want players seeing professional psychologists on a day-to-day basis unless there's a problem.
""It's like when clubs started to embrace strength and conditioning. It took a while for those practitioners to gain the trust of first team staff. We're still in the early days with psychology.""
Clifford is confident that ""there will be a time"" when psychologists and coaching teams work together more seamlessly, in part because of the influence a player's state of mind has on performance.
He believes that even if some of Carvalhaes' work could be viewed as ""crude by current standards"", there was also a ""far-sightedness to it that you can see in the roots of today's sports science"".
He adds: ""The role psychology plays in elite football is massive.
""As Bill Beswick (ex-England national team psychologist) once said: 'The mind is the athlete. The body is simply the means.'"""
Sports,"Canada reach World Cup: John Herdman - the English manager behind landmark qualification
Former Sunderland academy coach John Herdman has taken Canada to the World Cup
In England, memories of the 1986 World Cup centre around Diego Maradona, the 'Hand of God' and the wonder goal he scored for Argentina in that quarter-final win en route to lifting the trophy.
Canadian memories of that tournament in Mexico are somewhat different.
Three games, no points, no goals. At least they got there, though.
Until now, 1986 remained the only time Canada had qualified for a World Cup.
That all changed on Sunday, when a 4-0 win over Jamaica booked Canada's place at the 2022 Fifa World Cup. And it promises to be a golden period for them, since it is anticipated - but not yet confirmed - that their status as co-hosts for the 2026 tournament will bring automatic qualification.
This year's landmark achievement has come under the guidance of John Herdman, the English coach who led the Canadian women's team to successive bronze medal Olympic Games finishes in 2012 and 2016.
It is unlikely he will become the first English manager to win the World Cup since Sir Alf Ramsey in 1966, but Canada are upwardly mobile and they will pose a threat in Qatar.
Who will qualify for Qatar 2022?
'All the kids play football, that is the reality'
Alphonso Davies is the poster boy for Canadian football, though Herdman and his team have had to complete qualification without the Bayern Munich defender after he was diagnosed with a heart condition in January.
He is on the road to recovery and will hope to feature at the World Cup, along with the likes of Lille forward Jonathan David and Besiktas frontman Cyle Larin.
Those players are evidence of the growing strength of youth development in Canada - and the wider interest in football in a country that has traditionally focused on more established sports.
John Herdman: Canada side 'carrying the weight of a nation'
""Canada is a hockey nation, but football is the highest participation sport,"" said Herdman, speaking to BBC Sport in January.
""All the kids play football, that is the reality. The country has a very diverse demographic. We have a lot of immigrants, including myself, whose first love is football.
""But they have not had a national team to rally around. The women's team has been uber successful but the men's team hasn't broken that threshold.
""It is a sleeping giant. It is ready to put itself into the sporting consciousness of the genuine Canadian sports fan.""
Canada celebrate beating Mexico in Edmonton in November
Images of Canada celebrating in the snow after their win over Mexico in Edmonton in November were memorable.
Herdman and his staff had already worked out that Concacaf's gruelling qualification schedule was not set up to help his team.
The conditions play a big factor, with Canada often having to face opponents whose home climate is markedly different to the one Canada's players are used to.
""In Haiti, in June, it was 37 degrees,"" added Herdman. ""People's boots were melting on the rubber on the plastic turf.
""There are moments in those games where the opportunity to check out is there. The ability to say 'OK, we have an excuse, it is too hot'. The brain is always playing with that.
""It was time for our opponents to get that feeling.""
So the Mexico game was played in Edmonton, where the temperature during the match was recorded at -9C and the snow fell beforehand - lots of it.
""We could have played in a more hospitable climate, maybe even in a closed, indoor stadium, but we were pretty clear this was a new Canada,"" said Herdman.
""It is a very resilient nation that has grown up having to play on plastic fields and in cold conditions. We looked at it as an opportunity.
""When people say 'why haven't Canada qualified?' [for so long] you can see the challenges of managing the Concacaf window. Three games in seven days and thousands of miles of travelling to get those games done.""
The chip on the shoulder that drives him on
It is more than 20 years since Herdman, born in Consett in County Durham, left his job at Sunderland's academy to take over the New Zealand women's team.
The decision has worked, to the extent that the 46-year-old would be an attractive proposition for a coaching role if he decided to return to his homeland.
It is a conversation he skirts around, secure in the knowledge his contract with the Canadian FA does not expire until after the 2026 World Cup.
""There was a massive motivator at the time, when you haven't made it as a professional footballer,"" he said. ""You always have that chip on your shoulder.
""I didn't play at the highest level and, in my earliest years in coaching, that was relayed to me quite frequently. It develops a mentality of working harder to prove you are at that level.""
Archive: Alphonso Davies - the Bayern Munich player who was a refugee
Alphonso the 'influencer'
Davies' absence has been felt, but overall, Herdman refers to the 21-year-old as a ""generational talent"", capable of transporting Canadian soccer out of a niche environment and into mainstream society.
""He is an influencer, not only through what he has done on the field but through his social media presence,"" said Herdman.
""I have an 11-year-old daughter who is obsessed with what he is doing on Tik-Tok. She has never had an interest in soccer all the way through her time in Canada.
""We have a generation of fans for whom this is genuinely new.
""The hardcore fans are there setting the tone but the sports fans are the future now. They are going to fall in love with this sport."""
Sports,"Manchester City defender John Stones will miss England's friendly with Ivory Coast after returning to his club.
The 27-year-old suffered an injury in the warm-up for Saturday's 2-1 win against Switzerland, which meant he had to withdraw from the starting XI.
England boss Gareth Southgate is expected to make wholesale changes for Tuesday's game at Wembley.
Saturday's team mixed established and inexperienced players, with Tuesday's expected to follow a similar template.
""We'll make changes. We think that's the right thing to do,"" said Southgate.
""We want to keep all of the squad involved. I think that has been a strength for us. Players who come in perform well at the level and the team march on.
""They need to feel that we've got the confidence in them to go into any game and we're also at a stage of the season where their load is heavy and we've got to make sure we try and navigate that in the best way possible.""

'It is about the weight of the England shirt and how they cope'
All 24 players took part in training on Monday, including Arsenal's Emile Smith Rowe, who missed Saturday's game through injury, and Stones, who was replaced in the starting XI by Ben White after experiencing ""some tightness"".
After Monday's session he returned to his club as a precaution but Southgate confirmed that Harry Maguire will start at Wembley on Tuesday.
Stones is the seventh player to withdraw from Southgate's squad, with the others including Arsenal pair Aaron Ramsdale and Bukayo Saka, as well as Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold.
The team for Saturday's hard-fought win over the Swiss included debutants Marc Guehi, Kyle Walker-Peters and Tyrick Mitchell.
Their inclusion took England boss Southgate to the milestone of having used 100 players during his tenure, which began in 2016 and comprises 69 matches.
The proposed changes for Tuesday opens the door to the likes of Aston Villa pair Tyrone Mings and Oli Watkins, Southampton duo Fraser Forster and James Ward-Prowse, and Borussia Dortmund midfielder Jude Bellingham.
Forster - a late call-up in place of Ramsdale - could make his first England appearance since 2016.
There could also be a first start for Crystal Palace full-back Mitchell, who came off the bench for the final 30 minutes at the weekend.
""Whenever we bring players into the squad, it is great to see how they cope,"" said Southgate.
""Sometimes, it isn't about the opposition quality, although [against Switzerland] that was high. Sometimes, it is about the weight of an England shirt and whether they can cope.
""I thought all of the players who came in did really well. That was positive.
""I hope we have an environment where all the players feel comfortable and can be the best version of themselves in. A lot of that is down to the environment they have created.
""We have super characters; when younger players come in, the older ones are sitting with them at meal times, helping them feel relaxed and at ease.
""In terms of selection, we have players who have performed for England. There has to be some scrutiny on club form, because that has to be a factor, and then the opponent and who is suited to playing them.""
Harry Kane scored a penalty on Saturday to go level with Bobby Charlton as England's second top scorer of all time on 49 goals
'Kane sets the tone'
Harry Kane scored England's winner on Saturday from the penalty spot, taking his tally of international goals to 49 in 68 caps.
It takes him level with Sir Bobby Charlton as the second highest goalscorer in Three Lions history, four goals behind leading scorer Wayne Rooney.
Southgate hinted that Kane could be omitted from the starting XI for the game on Tuesday, but praised the 28-year-old Tottenham striker for the example he sets with his attitude.
""If he had his way, he'd play all the time,"" added Southgate. ""That is a brilliant quality to have.
""If your captain wants to be at every camp, playing every game, that sets the tone.
""We've got a good squad; we want to give people opportunities and to see things across the week to see if people can play at the level.
""We make the decision as to when he plays or doesn't, but I repeat, it is a good quality to have.""
Ivory Coast go into their first ever game against England having narrowly lost 2-1 to world champions France, courtesy of an injury-time Aurelien Tchouameni goal on Friday.
Les Elephants suffered an early exit in the recent Africa Cup of Nations, failed to qualify for the World Cup finals in Qatar and have recorded just one win in their last five friendlies.
However, their squad includes a number of players with Premier League experience including Crystal Palace forward Wilfred Zaha, Arsenal's Nicolas Pepe and Maxwell Cornet of Burnley.
Wolves' Willy Boly and Manchester United's Eric Bailly are likely to feature in defence, along with ex-Tottenham full-back Serge Aurier."

Life-sized table football figures in London as part of the build-up to Euro 22
Excitement levels for a home European Championship in the summer increased on Monday when London marked 100 days until the competition with an unveiling of life-sized table football figures - hours before further sell-out crowds were announced.
With over half of the tournament's tickets already sold in a pre-sale, the final at Wembley - set to take place on 31 July - sold out within an hour of the general sale on Monday morning.
It means the showcase finale could surpass the record for any Euros match in a men's or women's tournament.
And while fans scrambled to buy tickets online, London's colourful Carnaby Street was decorated with life-sized figures of female players from around Europe as some of the competition's stars posed for photographs with the trophy.
It is set to be the biggest Euros in women's football history - not just because of the demand for tickets but because the quality of competition has increased hugely in recent years.
""I think it's actually harder to win a Euros now than a World Cup,"" France international and Everton midfielder Kenza Dali told BBC Sport.
""In Europe the level is very close. At a World Cup you have some games where the gap is massive sometimes. At the Euros you can't pick a team and say they will win the Euros.
""There's Spain, England, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands... a lot of teams! It's really exciting. There's big competition and it's in a country which is big for football. Who is going to win?""

England deliver show for fans ahead of Euros
Were low crowds at Arnold Clark Cup a concern?
England are hoping to become European champions for the first time, having lost finals in 1984 and 2009.
They were knocked out in the semi-finals of the 2017 Euros by hosts the Netherlands, who went on to lift the trophy by beating Denmark in the final.
Chelsea defender Jess Carter said it is ""what people dream of"" to play at a home Euros, but the Lionesses will not set a specific measure on what would be considered a successful tournament on the pitch.
""I can't wait, the Euros will be unbelievable,"" Carter told BBC Sport.
""I think a successful tournament would be to make the nation proud and inspire hopefully a lot more younger children to play. As individuals, all we ever do is aim to do our best.
""I don't think it's fair to set a specific goal because there's so many stepping stones along the way. There are so many top teams there too. We are equally one of those, but our aim is to deliver our best on the biggest stage and see where that takes us.""
Carter, 24, said there are ""so many world-class players"" at the tournament and midfielder Dali is hoping theirs can carry France further than the quarter-final stage they have reached for the last three successive Euros.
Dali, 30, says their poor record in the competition means France should not be considered among the favourites.
""A lot of people see us as a favourite, but I don't understand why because there are so many teams who have won trophies and we have never,"" she added. ""We have never reached a final for example.
""Maybe it's because the French teams have done well in Europe and the Champions League so people think we can be favourites, but the national team is completely different.
""Obviously we have a really good team and prepare well. We will be ready for this competition but we need to find a way to collectively do better than the last one. That's the objective.""
The Netherlands won the 2017 Euros in their home country and England are hoping to do the same in 2022
The Netherlands' success at the last Euros ended an incredible run by Germany, who had won the tournament six times in a row.
They are serial winners in the competition, having won it eight times in total before they lost their crown in 2017. Having also been beaten by England for the first time in the UK last month, have they lost their fear factor?
""I think so,"" Germany and Chelsea goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger told BBC Sport. ""We had that transition period in the last two years and then every other country has stepped up now as well.
""Germany are not the biggest fear anymore, but we're trying to get back to that. It's sometimes good to not always have everyone expecting you to be good.
""You can prove them wrong - I quite like it, I quite like being the underdogs and almost showing off.""
Berger thinks England's victory at the Arnold Clark Cup in February showed the growth they have made under manager Sarina Wiegman.
Asked whether the perception of England has changed too, she added: ""Oh, 100%. I can see it first-hand how the girls are talking when they go to camp.
""They are happy going to camp and want to do better. How [Wiegman] is treating people and dealing with things has been really helpful for England. You could see it at the Arnold Clark Cup.
""England are probably one of the favourites this year because they have the depth. That's what you need in a tournament - not just the 11 players. The rest of them are pretty good as well!"""
Sports,"Wunderkids: Building football’s most exciting young XI - week seven: Josko Gvardiol, centre-back
It is the stuff of management dreams - a blank cheque to build the most exciting young starting XI in world football.
But that is exactly what new BBC Sounds podcast Wunderkids is offering, in fantasy form at least, over its 11 episodes. The first seven episodes are available to listen to now.
The Wunderkids team, in conjunction with BBC Sport, have come up with 11 players - and presenter Steve Crossman will be joined by experts to discuss the latest inclusion, with one new player revealed each week.
So far, those to have made the cut are new Manchester City forward Julian Alvarez, Bayer Leverkusen winger Florian Wirtz, Ajax midfielder Ryan Gravenberch, Santos defender Kaiky, Barcelona midfielder Gavi and Rennes winger Kamaldeen Sulemana - and now RB Leipzig defender Josko Gvardiol joins them.
Gvardiol was spotted at eight years old by Croatia's most successful club, Dinamo Zagreb, and he joined the same academy that acted as the finishing school for Luka Modric and Mateo Kovacic.
After playing at left-back or centre-midfield, an academy coach moved him into central defence. And so Gvardiol developed into one of the most sought-after commodities in the modern game - a left-sided centre-back who's comfortable on the ball.
He made his league debut at 17 in 2019, scoring the only goal in his second league appearance, and Dinamo went on to win the league title in 2019-20.
Gvardiol had also caught the eye in the Uefa Youth League and Leeds United reportedly made a bid before he signed for Leipzig on a five-year contract for 16m euros (£13.4m), plus add-ons, in September 2020.
He remained on loan with Dinamo for 2020-21, winning another league title, before making his international debut last June, and he did enough to earn his first start as Croatia lost 1-0 to England in the opening game of Euro 2020.
At 19 years, four months and 21 days, Gvardiol surpassed Kovacic's record of being the country's youngest player at a major tournament and he started every game before Croatia bowed out in the last 16.
After linking up with Leipzig he soon established himself in Germany, making his Champions League debut in the 6-3 loss at Manchester City last September.
Only two Leipzig players have made more league starts this term than the 20-year-old.
Since he was a child, he's been built like a tank. He can go forward, he can jump, he can tackle - he can do everything you want. He can play with the ball at his feet, he can play against those big attackers, he can play against the guys with pace and technical abilities.
After scoring his first goal at 17, he waited two or three hours to get the tram. Fans were saying 'you just scored the winning goal', and he said 'this is just a normal thing for me, to go home'. He had pictures with fans and looks at everybody the same - he seems a normal guy who happens to play football.
He's 100% focused on football, drives a Volkswagen rather than a Mercedes or Ferrari. He learned everything he had to know before he went to Leipzig.
In Croatia we like to compare him to Virgil van Dijk, because he's built that way (6ft 1in). He's one of his role models in football and he's also mentioned Thiago Silva and Sergio Ramos - Ramos because he's also one of those players who likes to score as many goals as he can.
In my opinion, I think he can be as good as Virgil one day. When you see how he behaves on the field and off the field, he's one of those guys where you'd say 'he's going to succeed'.
He had an offer from the Premier League. Leeds called and it was 99% that deal was going to happen. Although Leeds offered him a bigger salary [than Leipzig] and said he would be a starter, he decided to go to the Bundesliga because he wanted to do one more step before going to the Premier League.
And even though he didn't sign for Leeds, he already started to watch their games to see how he could adapt as quickly as possible.
What does the fan say?
Tobias (co-founder RB Leipzig fan club Red Campus)
I think Gvardiol is one of the best centre-backs in the Bundesliga. He has a high pass accuracy, a lot of duels won, especially in the air, and a lot of interceptions per game.
When he was at Dinamo Zagreb, he was handed a sheet with some tactics from RB Leipzig and he learned them.
When he arrived at our club last summer he already knew what he had to do when he started in the Bundesliga and I think that's one of the reasons why he is so good right now. We're very glad we have him."

Sports,"Kick it Out: How discrimination in football is being tackled one-on-one
Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford were subjected to racist abuse after England's penalty shootout defeat by Italy at the European Championship final
When England were beaten on penalties in the European Championships final last summer, the abuse was instantaneous.
Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho, who had penalties saved, and Marcus Rashford, who missed his effort, were subjected to a torrent of hate-filled messages on social media.
At the time, the racist abuse directed at England's black players was the most high profile, ugly example of it.
The UK Football Policing Unit said they received 600 reports of racist comments sent to the trio after the defeat. Of those, 207 were judged to be criminal.
Among them was 52-year-old Jonathon Best who livestreamed his abuse on Facebook. He was sentenced to 10 weeks in prison in November.
Widescale abuse has become commonplace in the game, leading Manchester City and England striker Raheem Sterling to call it a ""disease"" in society.
Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha is among the leading voices that have has called for ""action"", ""education"" and ""change"".
A 12-year-old boy who sent racist messages to Zaha received education sessions ""as part of the restorative justice process"".
That education was delivered by anti-discrimination charity Kick it Out and is one programme that authorities are turning to, to tackle abuse.
Kick it Out's fan education and engagement manager Alan Bush deals with referrals.
""It's very much trying to get them to have a look at their behaviour and what they've said, to try and get them to understand that the action or the act that they've taken part in is offensive, is hurtful and is against the law,"" Bush said.
""We've done some work with a 12-year-old on a youth conditional caution. He said something nine months ago and he has had three sessions. He has grown from the first session to the third session.""
The programme, which has run for more than two years and has dealt with people aged between 12 and 64 years old, is the only one in football which offered one-on-one ""rehabilitative sessions"".
'We're trying to get the individual to think about their impact' - Alan Bush
Kick it Out said around 20% of attendees are aged under 18, around 25% are aged between 18 and 30, and those who are over 50 make up 12%.
Bush says he is ""careful not to label people"" who come into the programme, despite what led to them being there.
""I want them to learn,"" said Bush, who has hosted about 60 educational sessions.
""I want them to see that they may not see themselves as racist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic - but what they are is an individual who has delivered something in the stadium, online, and the act would have been discriminatory.""
People in the programme are made to take responsibility for what they have done, to talk through the reasons for being there and confront other examples of discrimination in the game.
The image of John Barnes back-heeling a banana off the pitch - a picture that captures the abuse the former England and Liverpool forward faced during his career - is one infamous example used.
Liverpool's John Barnes backheels a banana that was thrown on to the pitch during a game at Everton in 1988
Abuse faced by Saka, Sancho and Rashford last summer has also become part of the course.
""The amount of people that were offended, affected and were horrified at the abuse that went on post-Euros and of course the Euros final, and the few minutes after the final, I think that people look at that and they're able to understand it, they're able to put a level of emotion, empathy or a level of understanding on it,"" added Bush.
""It links their behaviour to something that was so horrendous and was newsworthy for a significant amount of time. With the majority of people who will be English and will have supported England, I don't think you were able to get away from that.""
The majority of people that attend sessions do so voluntarily, although some are mandatory as part of a young person's Youth Conditional Caution. Failure to engage could see the person charged for the initial incident.
Referrals can be made through local councils, fans groups and police.
Clubs also access Kick it Out's services, with individuals almost always already serving a ban. Feedback in a report from Bush helps determine if any ban is overturned.
Bush says that as far as he is aware, no-one who has passed through the course has reoffended.
""The idea is we want to see attitude change,"" he stressed. ""We want to see behaviour change, and we want that to be sustainable."""
Sports,"Euro 2022: Wembley final set to break records
Hosts England won the inaugural Arnold Clark Cup in February
The attendance at the Women's European Championship final at Wembley on 31 July could surpass the record for any Euros match for men or women.
Tickets for the tournament decider sold out within an hour of going on sale.
Wembley has a capacity of 90,000, while the highest attendance for any Euros match - men or women - is 79,115 for the 1964 final at Madrid's Bernabeu.
Last year's men's final between England and Italy was attended by 67,173 with Covid restrictions limiting capacity.
The current record attendance for a Women's European Championship final is 41,302, which was set at Euro 2013 when Germany defeated hosts Sweden. For the rebuilt Wembley, the attendance record for any football match is 89,874 for the 2008 FA Cup final between Cardiff and Portsmouth.
Prior to tickets going on general sale on Monday, more than half of the 700,000 tickets available across the tournament had already been sold in pre-sales.
With 100 days to go until Euro 2022 kicks off with England's opening game against Austria at Old Trafford, the tournament is already comfortably on course to surpass the 240,045 who watched the 2017 tournament in the Netherlands - the previous best figure for total attendance across a Women's Euros.
The Football Association's head of women's football Baroness Sue Campbell said: ""The pleasing thing is it is not just England matches that have caught the imagination but also that there is interest in other competing teams.
""We are all hoping it is going to be a summer to remember where we can celebrate the very best of women's football.""
""I can't wait to see fans of all ages cheering the players on and hopefully all generations feeling inspired to get involved as a player, coach, referee or volunteer.""
""I think it's absolutely massive knowing there will be that much support - although not all of it will be for us,"" England and Chelsea defender Jess Carter told BBC Sport.
""It shows the growth of the women's game that we are able to sell-out stadiums like that well in advance and it shows the way the game is going. Hopefully the tournament is massive, a great stage for women's football and it continues to go that way.""
The Lionesses' matches against Norway at Brighton's Amex stadium and Northern Ireland at St Mary's have also sold out.
Sixteen nations will take part in the tournament across 10 different venues in England, with the opening match on 6 July."
Sports,"Cristiano Ronaldo says Portugal's World Cup play-off final with North Macedonia is a ""matter of life and death"".
North Macedonia, ranked 67th in the world, go to Porto looking to qualify for the World Cup for the first time, having stunned Italy 1-0 in the semis.
This is likely to be Manchester United forward Ronaldo's last shot at a World Cup unless he plays on until he's 41.
""I urge the fans - I want hell breaking loose at Dragao [Stadium],"" said the captain, 37, of Tuesday's game.
Portugal, who beat Turkey 3-1 in the semi-finals, last failed to reach a World Cup in 1998.
Ronaldo added: ""I went to bed last night thinking that I want the stadium to shut down the music for our national anthem and let the fans sing it acapella to show our passion, our strength and union around the objective of reaching the World Cup.
""For us, this game is a matter of life and death. There is a responsibility to win this game. For us, also a game of our lives. They have surprised [opponents] in many games but I believe they will not surprise us.""
Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in men's international football with 115 goals, including seven across four World Cups.
He led his country to glory in Euro 2016, but this is likely to be his final chance to win a World Cup.
""The one who will decide my future is me,"" said Ronaldo. ""If I want to play more, I play. If I don't want to, I don't play.""
Portugal coach Fernando Santos has hinted he will quit if they lose.
""If we think that, theoretically, the Macedonians are weaker, we are on the wrong track, it's the worst possible scenario,"" he said.
""We have to face North Macedonia as we would have faced Italy.""
North Macedonia have enjoyed an amazing year, having beaten Germany 2-1 in World Cup qualifying in March 2021, before playing at Euro 2020 - their first major tournament.
Blagoja Milevski, who replaced Igor Angelovski after Euro 2020, has only lost one of his eight games in charge.
Aleksandar Trajkovski's injury-time strike from outside the box helped them beat European champions Italy 1-0 in a stunning semi-final upset in Palermo.
""We won against one of the best teams in the world,"" said Milevski. ""We won't stop here. We have one last step to get to the World Cup.
""We are well on our way to confirming why we are among the top 20 teams in Europe.""
Napoli midfielder Elif Elmas said: ""This will be one of our most difficult matches, but also certainly the most exciting for all of us.
""We are 90 minutes away from the World Cup and fulfilling our childhood dreams - not only ours, but the whole of North Macedonia. We must not miss our chance and we have to give everything on the pitch to succeed."""
Sports,"England v Ivory Coast: Harry Maguire still has the faith of Gareth Southgate
There's no doubt Maguire is capable of playing at the highest level - Southgate
Harry Maguire has shown he can play at the highest level, according to Gareth Southgate - but the England manager warned that players ""can't be poor for a couple of years"".
The Manchester United defender's club form has been criticised this season.
Maguire, 29, is set to start England's friendly against Ivory Coast.
""He has got us to a World Cup semi-final and a Euros final so there is no doubt he is capable of playing at the highest level,"" said Southgate.
In November, former United captain Roy Keane said Maguire's form had been ""a disgrace"".
The defender, who has won 41 caps for England, has faced more criticism in recent weeks, particularly for the way his team conceded goals against Burnley, Southampton, Atletico Madrid and Manchester City.
After Manchester United lost to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League last 16 earlier this month, BBC Sport's chief football writer Phil McNulty said Maguire has been playing ""with an air of desperation"".
Southgate to make wholesale changes for Ivory Coast
Football Daily podcast: Southgate's England XI - Loyalty v Stupidity
Southgate left Maguire on the bench for Saturday's friendly win over Switzerland, with the centre-back set to be restored to the starting XI against Ivory Coast on Tuesday.
""He was very good for us in the autumn. His club is in a difficult moment - there are any number of reasons for that,"" said Southgate.
""That doesn't mean players can be poor for couple of years and still find their way in.
""[Continuing to select players] also sometimes depends on competition for places.
""We have left some forward players out who haven't been in good form. But there are direct and experienced replacements for those players. It is a complicated decision.""
'There's a difference between loyalty and stupidity'
Asked how important a game it is for Maguire on Tuesday, former England striker Chris Sutton told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""Enormous. He's had a bang average season at Manchester United, and I think that's being kind to him.
""Gareth [Southgate] is very loyal so at this moment in time, we all think Harry Maguire will start for England in the World Cup.
""But loyalty can only take you so far. Eventually there has to be a cut-off. If his form doesn't improve then somebody else will have to step in.
""There's a difference between loyalty and stupidity, and if Maguire keeps performing badly then Gareth's got no choice but to play somebody else.""
Players won't shy away from Qatar questions - Mings
England defender Tyrone Mings says the squad will not ""shy away"" from the ongoing discussion about Qatar's suitability to host the 2022 World Cup.
The host nation's human rights record has been a recurring subject since it was awarded the tournament, while homosexuality is illegal in the Arab country and women's rights are also a subject of ongoing debate.
Additionally, a report in the Guardian last year claimed 6,500 migrant workers have died in the country since it was awarded the World Cup 12 years ago - although Qatar disputes those figures.
Echoing the words of skipper Harry Kane last week, Mings said the England players want to use their platform to ""try and improve rights"" for other people.
""On Qatar hosting the World Cup, it's not our fault it's there,"" the Aston Villa centre-back told BBC Radio 5 Live.
""What we can do is accept the responsibility of trying to cast a light on some of the topics and some of the issues out there.
I don't know what a World Cup boycott achieves - Southgate
""We are obviously players who enjoy playing football, but it is also quite an honour to be asked about these things. Back in the day I don't think footballers would have been front and centre talking on human rights issues or topics going on around the world.
""That's the responsibility we take on, but we didn't choose where the World Cup is, all we can do now is try and use our platform to try and improve rights for other people.
""We are not going to change the world, but we will do our very best to do what we can.""
Ivory Coast still want Guehi to play for them
Ivory Coast have still not given up hope of persuading Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi to represent them, despite the 21-year-old being in line to win his second England cap against the country where he was born.
Guehi, who made his Three Lions debut against Switzerland on Saturday, moved to London aged one.
But Ivory Coast manager Patrice Beaumelle wants the former Chelsea youth player to switch allegiance - and it would still be possible because Guehi has not yet appeared in a competitive international.
""I know he can still choose Ivory Coast so we are working on that. I tried to contact him several weeks ago before his decision,"" said Beaumelle.
""When I saw him in the English lists I understood that, at the moment, he wants to try with the Three Lions.
""But the choice has to come from the heart, he will make his own decision. I will wait a few weeks and try to contact him to know if he is interested."""
Sports,"Top Football Tweets: Everyone is making memes about the Oscars
Football Twitter has joined in on the conversation about Will Smith and Chris Rock at the Oscars.
It was a weekend of drama at the Oscars and blockbuster, Hollywood action in the National League.
While Twitter has been overtaken by the fallout from Will Smith hitting Chris Rock onstage at the Oscars ceremony, Wrexham and Dover Athletic exchanged blows in a heavyweight encounter and Hollywood star, and Wrexham owner, Ryan Reynolds could barely stand the drama.
Plus, elsewhere, Christian Eriksen gave us another feel-good moment.
All of this and more, is among this weekend's best football tweets.
 Everyone's making the same joke
The biggest talking point of the weekend happened outside of a footballing arena - when Will Smith hit Chris Rock at the Oscars, in response to the comedian, who was presenting at the awards show, making a joke about Smith's wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.
Nobody has been able to stop discussing it since and there has been a scramble by football accounts to make a sporting analogy, from Lee Bowyer's famous on-field fight with team-mate Kieron Dyer…
…to Rangers' Ryan Kent lashing out at former Celtic player Scott Brown in 2019…
…to former Manchester United player Marouane Fellaini taking a ball to the face.
Going early
The US men's team enjoyed a big win on Sunday - beating Panama 5-1 in World Cup qualifying. They slightly jumped the gun with their post-match celebrations, however, as the team unveiled a banner reading, 'qualified' on-field, despite the fact that there is still a game left to play.
It's all been a bit much for some, including World Cup winner Heather O'Reilly.
Hollywood action
Among all of the Oscars chaos, there was some real drama in the National League on Saturday, where Wrexham went from 2-0 up against Dover Athletic, to 5-2 down, before eventually coming back to win the match 6-5, with two stoppage-time goals.
Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds is a co-owner of the Welsh club. He said that the match shaved years off his life and spoke about being buried in Wales.
If Wrexham, chasing promotion back to the EFL, play many more games like that one, he may want to invest in a plot soon.
The Swiss ditch their neutrality
A home win over Switzerland helped England make it eight games unbeaten since they lost the Euro 2020 final to Italy on penalties.
Italy have subsequently and rather shockingly failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup and their European neighbours Switzerland wasted no time in reminding them.
Happy returns
The feel-good story of the weekend came from 30-year-old Christian Eriksen. The midfielder was back in the Denmark squad on Saturday for the first time since he suffered cardiac arrest against Finland during Euro 2020 nine months ago.
Coming on for his 110th cap as a second-half substitute, it took Eriksen only two minutes to find the net with a fine finish.
Cleat dreams
Liverpool forward Katie Stengel scored to help the Championship team beat Durham on Sunday and afterwards delivered a reminder that professional women's football isn't all glitz and glamour.
Looks familiar
Meanwhile, there was a Liverpool v Barcelona legends game at Anfield on Saturday, which saw some old, familiar faces return.
Tears of joy
Bayern Munich and Canada left-back Alphonso Davies burst into tears on Sunday during a live stream on Twitch, as he watched his national team qualify for the men's World Cup for the first time in 36 years.
Report
Canada sealed qualification with a 4-0 win over Jamaica. The last World Cup they played in was Mexico 1986, when they finished bottom of their group without scoring.
Davies has not played since 17 December because of heart muscle inflammation that occurred after he was infected by Covid-19."
Sports,"Lyndon Dykes on 'following heart' for Scotland & mentality shift
Striker Lyndon Dykes is itching to get back on the goal trail after missing the chance to break a Scotland record that had stood for 52 years.
The QPR forward, 26, scored in four successive internationals last year, matching Colin Stein's 1969 feat.
Suspension and injury has kept him out of the last three games but he is fit for Tuesday's friendly with Austria.
""I was gutted I missed them because I was so focused on beating that record,"" he told BBC Scotland.
Former Livingston and Queen of the South striker Dykes netted crucial goals against Moldova, Austria, Israel and the Faroe Islands as he helped Scotland finish in a World Cup play-off spot behind group winners Denmark.
His tally for Scotland stands at six goals and he is hungry for more.
Robertson & Dykes back for Scotland
'I see myself as Scottish'
The QPR frontman has been absent for the English Championship side's last seven games with a hamstring problem, but a return to fitness coincides with Scotland's trip to Vienna.
An appearance would take Dykes' cap tally to 21 - all of which have been gained in a whirlwind 18 months that he has ""enjoyed every moment of"".
It all could have been very different for the Australia-born striker, who had to decide whether to represent his homeland or Scotland, where both his parents are from, in 2020.
""You don't often have two choices like that,"" Dykes added. ""I followed my heart and what was best for myself - that was Scotland. I look at myself as being Scottish, my wife and my son are Scottish.
""I know my accent doesn't sound it, but I've grown up in that scenery and been around Scots when I was younger. I had to follow my head and my heart. I've never regretted the decision and I never will.""
'Scotland mentality has changed'
Reflecting on his first Scotland call-up, Dykes recalled a ""dark cloud"" of negativity over the national team.
But Steve Clarke's side have since ended a 23-year absence from major men's tournaments after reaching Euro 2020 and ended last year on a six-game winning run to earn a World Cup play-off spot.
Dykes, who was playing second-tier football in Scotland in 2019, has been an inspirational figure in Scotland's resurgence, but the striker is keen to point all the credit in the direction of manager Clarke.
""A lot of people had thoughts of Scotland being a squad that couldn't change their mentality,"" Dykes said. ""We've changed that. He's helped with changing the mentality of Scottish football in the international scene.
""We had to get out that slump. I've got nothing but high praise for him. You want to play for him because he's such a good guy. Now I think our squad is dangerous and teams will be aware of us."""
Sports,"Northern Ireland captain Steven Davis will look to take another step towards full fitness in Tuesday night's friendly with Hungary at Windsor Park.
Rangers midfielder Davis, 37, came off the bench to score in Friday's 3-1 win over Luxembourg.
He played just under half an hour in only his second appearance for club or country since 12 January due to injury.
""It was really nice to get on the pitch and build up fitness,"" added Davis, who is expected to start for his 134th cap.
Davis' only appearance in the last two months was a brief cameo as Rangers routed Hearts 5-0.
He added: ""Physically I feel good, the injury has felt good. It's been a good week for me so far, hopefully I can get some more minutes tomorrow and take another step in the right direction.""
Davis and Whyte strike late as N Ireland win in Luxembourg
'More game time on a regular basis'
Davis has been in and out of the Rangers squad in recent weeks as he has dealt with niggling injuries.
""It's always frustrating,"" he said. ""I've missed out on some big games and just when I felt I was getting myself back to a good position I've picked up another injury. It's part and parcel of football.
""The good thing is they've been minor injuries but it's been two consecutively on the bounce.
""The key for me is to get back into a rhythm of training and hopefully get more game time on a regular basis because that's what my body has been used to.""
The midfielder took his tally of international goals to 13 with his late strike at Stade de Luxembourg on Friday.
'We're going to freshen it up a bit'
Davis' return to the side is likely to be one of a number that manager Ian Baraclough makes to the side that started on Friday.
Jonny Evans has returned to Leicester as planned after clocking an hour on Friday night, but Paddy McNair and keeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell are available again, while Ali McCann and Dan Ballard will be hoping to start.
""We want a positive performance,"" Baraclough said. ""We're going to make changes and we're going to freshen it up a bit, but we still have to have that intensity in game irrespective of opposition.
""Hungary are going to be sterner test, no disrespect to Luxembourg, but we're going to have to be bang at it.""
Bailey Peacock-Farrell and Paddy McNair return to the NI squad for the game against Hungary
Hungary are ranked 41st in the Fifa standings, compared to their opponents' 54th place.
The match will offer a final workout for Northern Ireland before they play four Nations League matches in the space of 10 days in June.
Baraclough's men have kept a clean sheet in each of their last four matches at Windsor Park so will be keen to extend that sequence on Tuesday.
This is their first meeting with the Hungarians since a Euro 2016 qualifier in Belfast in September 2015, which ended in a 1-1 draw.
It's the seventh encounter overall between the sides, with Northern Ireland winning one and drawing one of their previous six matches."
Sports,"Keith Andrews has praised Republic of Ireland manager Stephen Kenny's strength of character after watching him battle his way through a difficult start to his reign.
Kenny failed to win any of his first 10 games in charge, leading to criticism of his appointment and methods.
He stood firm and has since been rewarded with a sequence of 11 games which has included just one defeat.
""He was very composed, always sticking to his principles,"" reflected Andrews.
The Republic's only loss in that much improved run of form saw an away reverse against Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal, with Saturday's 2-2 draw against Belgium - ranked number one in the world - providing another indicator of an upturn in their fortunes.
Kenny will send his side into friendly battle with Lithuania on Tuesday night having recently signed a contract extension.
The Republic boss is expected to make changes to his line-up, with some senior players such as skipper Seamus Coleman likely to sit out the match.
Belgium draw shows how far Republic have come - Ogbene
'We had to endure some not-very-nice days'
Asked how he had been behind the scenes during that difficult early period, assistant Andrews added: ""He very much had that belief in what the players are capable of achieving.
""Of course we'd make little tweaks here and there, but he's a very strong individual and I thought he dealt with it remarkably well because there were some not-very-nice days that we had to endure. You've got to take it on the chin.
""I say it to him quite often about when I go back into my local butcher's, they're quick to tell me about we should and shouldn't be doing, and sometimes it's not particularly pleasant.
""But during that process, he stood really firm. It would be very, very easy as the manager to maybe stake a step back, to sacrifice, maybe, some of your values, your principles for a short-term view, but he stood by it and obviously I was in full support of that.""
Andrews has helped Stephen Kenny take the Republic in a new direction
Former Ireland midfielder Andrews first spoke out in defence of Kenny in September last year. While he admits results will always determine a manager's future, he firmly believed the Republic were always heading in the right direction.
He said: ""Football being football, it's always results-dependent and you're always beholden to the powers that be.
""It's not development football, we're in big boys' football here, that's the nature of the business, that ultimately if results didn't come, then decisions have to be made.
""Like I said, we felt we were in a good place even though the results hadn't been good, we were comfortable with what we were putting in place and the results did come.""
'Taking the team in a different direction'
Andrews was drafted into the international set-up by former manager Giovanni Trapattoni, whose safety-first approach paid dividends, but did not necessarily gain admirers.
Kenny's approach is more expansive and while his team remains a work in progress, Andrews shares his philosophy.
He said: ""The Ireland team that I played in was very well organised, very difficult to break down. The main focus was what we did without the ball.
""There was a big reliance on the technical players with most ability, in an attacking sense. It was based around that, with a manager who probably didn't have enough belief in what we could do, or was stuck in the way he had always seen the game and always coached.
""Stephen and myself see it differently and have tried to take the team in a different direction."""

The ECA, which is hosting its general assembly in Vienna, has suspended all seven Russian members.
""Our hearts go out to our Ukrainian friends here today,"" Al-Khelaifi said.
""The suffering we are witnessing reminds us about what truly matters.""
Ukraine FA first vice-president Oleh Protasov and Shakhtar Donetsk chief executive Serghiy Palkin were present to hear Paris St-Germain chairman Al-Khelaifi make the pledge as he opened the two-day assembly.
""We are living through troubling times,"" Al-Khelaifi said. ""We have all grieved to see the violent attacks.
""We call for peace.""
In announcing the donation, Al-Khelaifi added: ""I am very proud to announce that ECA will make available an initial one million euro financial contribution in supporting our members' efforts in assisting the Ukrainian people. Many of our clubs have also offered to find a safe place for Ukrainian youth academy players.

He is now set to start against Serbia on the pitch where he collapsed in last year's Euro 2020 game with Finland.
""That will be even more special,"" he told Danish TV station Kanal 5.
""[Saturday's goal] was just a warm-up for Tuesday when I'll be running in exactly the place where it happened.""
The 30-year-old, who was fitted with an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) - a type of pacemaker - after his cardiac arrest nine months ago, was given a standing ovation as he was introduced from the bench on Saturday.
There are sure to be more emotional scenes on Tuesday, with Denmark coach Kasper Hjulmand having already confirmed that Eriksen will start.
Both Denmark and Serbia have qualified for this year's World Cup in Qatar.
The Danes finished top of their qualifying group with 27 points from 10 games - four points clear of runners-up Scotland.

The 20-year-old fought back from a break down in the opening set before Norrie upped his aggression at the net to take it on a tie-break.
Norrie's experience showed in the second as he staved off three break points in his opening service game before breaking Draper at the first chance.
Draper was given a warning for ball abuse after being broken but continued to pressure Norrie's serve, forcing his opponent to save another four break points in the next game.
However, Norrie was able to close out victory to move closer to breaking into the top 10.
""It's not easy against Jack. He's such a big talent and hits the ball big on both sides,"" Norrie added.
""The court surprised me a little bit as it was very slow out there. I managed to play the bigger points a little bit better than he did and that was the difference in the end.""

""I know how much work it takes to bring the best out of yourself. I've said it to my team multiple times, 'I just don't have that in me any more.' Physically, I have nothing more to give. I've given absolutely everything I have to this beautiful sport of tennis, and I'm really happy with that.
""For me, that is my success. Thank you to everyone who has supported me along the way. I'll always be grateful for the lifelong memories we created together.""

Sports Desk podcast: why do sportspeople find it so hard to stay retired?
'I don't think Barty will play again' - analysis
BBC Sport tennis correspondent Russell Fuller
Like everyone else my reaction is one of huge surprise. But I don't think we really will see Barty playing tennis again. There was a feeling in the sport she would always be a player who retired young. No-one saw it coming at 25 though.
Wimbledon was the main goal, the Australian Open was the icing on the cake.
We should remember she has taken a break from the sport before, to play cricket primarily but also because she had been suffering from depression and homesickness.
You can never say never but she said she wanted to enjoy the next phase of her life as Ash Barty the person, rather than Ash Barty the athlete.
Legacy of 'ultimate competitor' - reaction
The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.View original tweet on Twitter
Former British player Annabel Croft said the ""tennis world was in complete shock"" over Barty's retirement but feels the move ""makes perfect sense"" if she feels she has nothing left to give.
Women's Tennis Association head Steve Simon said Barty was ""one of the great champions"".
""Ashleigh Barty with her signature slice backhand, complemented by being the ultimate competitor, has always led by example through the unwavering professionalism and sportsmanship she brought to every match,"" he said in a statement.
Fellow Australian Grand Slam winners also paid tribute. Former US Open champion Sam Stosur hailed Barty's ""incredible career"", while 15-time quad singles Grand Slam champion Dylan Alcott said Barty was a ""champion in every sense of the word"".
Romanian former world number one Simona Halep added: ""What's next for you? Grand Slam champion in golf?!""
Great Britain's Andy Murray reacted to the news by saying he was ""gutted for tennis"" but happy for Barty.
Retired French player Marion Bartoli - who won Wimbledon in 2013 and retired just months later at the age of 28 - said she could ""absolutely relate"" to Barty's words.
""When I finally won Wimbledon in 2013 I had a little bit of fire in my belly that was just gone,"" Bartoli told BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast. ""When you chase something that is so hard to achieve for so long, and you've finally done it - you feel drained. You feel empty. And for Ash, she had the Australian Open around the corner, she definitely felt that if she could win that would be the cherry on the cake.
""But after that, she felt that she couldn't really sustain the amount of training and intensity that is required to stay at the top of the women's game. So I can absolutely understand the decision.""
Barty's Australian Open win had cemented her reputation as a national hero. In an emotional moment, she was presented with her trophy by fellow Aboriginal Australian tennis champion and mentor Evonne Goolagong Cawley.
A recent report by The Age newspaper highlighted how the number of Australian children playing tennis had climbed by nearly 30% in the past year. Many of them are from Indigenous communities and many are girls.
""I'm really proud that I can be a small part of getting more kids into sport and chasing their dreams,"" Barty told BBC Sport in January.
Barty took a break from tennis in 2014, citing its intense demands, and played in the inaugural season of cricket's Women's Big Bash League.
She said that was ""a very different feeling"" to her retirement on Wednesday, adding tennis had ""given me all my dreams plus more"".
Belgian Justine Henin also retired from tennis while world number one at the age of 25 before announcing she would return to play 16 months later. She retired a second time the following year.
Fellow Belgian Kim Clijsters retired at the age of 23 in 2007 but returned two years later and went on to win three of her four Grand Slam singles titles after her comeback."
Sports,"Naomi Osaka bounces back with first-round win in Miami after Indian Wells exit
Osaka missed much of the 2021 season has dropped to 77 in the world rankings
Japan's Naomi Osaka says she wants to move on from her traumatic early exit at Indian Wells after winning her opening match at the Miami Open.
The former world number one beat Australia's Astra Sharma 6-3 6-4, 10 days after heckling from the crowd reduced her to tears during a second-round defeat by Veronika Kudermetova.
""I didn't want to let anything bother me, no matter what happened,"" said 24-year-old Osaka, who added that ""the last match I played was not the greatest memory for me"".
""I wanted to prove that I could come back out here and compete, and no matter if I won or lost, to just know that I had the best attitude I could.""
Osaka's win was her 50th in WTA 1000 tournaments and sets up second-round meeting with 13th seed Angelique Kerber.
In the men's draw, Australia's Nick Kyrgios sealed a comfortable first-round victory over Frenchman Adrian Mannarino.
Wildcard Kyrgios, who has slipped down the world rankings from 13th to 102, hit 12 aces and did not face a single break point in his 7-6 6-3 win.
""It was a hell of a performance,"" said Kyrgios, who stressed that he will be a ""complete underdog"" when he faces Russian fifth seed Andrey Rublev in the second round.
Britain's Jack Draper, the world number 146, is also through to round two where he will face British number one Cameron Norrie.
Draper, 20, beat Frenchman Gilles Simon 7-5 6-1 to earn his first Masters-level victory and boost his hopes of moving into the world's top 100."
Sports,"Ashleigh Barty: Retiring world number one says 'wait and see' on plans
Ashleigh Barty: ‘I’m excited for my next chapter’
World number one Ashleigh Barty told people to ""wait and see"" about her next move following her shock retirement at the age of 25.
The Australian three-time Grand Slam champion said she had ""given everything"" to tennis.
Barty did not rule out trying another sport but said she was more keen to ""give back"" to the community.
""I have always wanted to have the time to contribute more in other ways and now I have that opportunity,"" she said.
""That is what lights me up inside.""
Barty said she was particularly excited to help provide fellow Indigenous Australians with ""more opportunity to get into the sport"" from a young age.
A talented all-round sportswoman, she played in the first season of cricket's Women's Big Bash League in 2015-16 after taking a break from tennis in 2014.
Asked about reports she could take up golf or Australian Rules football, she said: ""I have always been an athlete in terms of trying different things, so we'll see how we go.""
'Barty's time at the top too short for tennis'
'A wholesome character who everyone thinks is their mate'
The Sports Desk podcast: Life after retirement
Barty won the French Open in 2019 and Wimbledon in 2021, and in January this year became the first home player to win the Australian Open men's or women's singles title in 44 years.
On Thursday Barty said she had started thinking about retirement after her Wimbledon triumph.
She revealed she last picked up a racquet about 10 days ago, but that an injury after the Australian Open had taken longer to heal than she had hoped.
Former Grand Slam champions Kim Clijsters and Justine Henin returned to tennis after retiring.
Asked about about one day making a comeback, Barty said: ""Well, you never say never. It's a long way off.""
Barty said she had been ""spoiled"" by many messages of support from other players since her announcement on Wednesday.
She also confirmed she had set a wedding date with fiance Gary Kissik, but did not give further details.
Coach Craig Tyzzer said Barty's decision was ""not a shock for me"".
""Ash does her own thing. I think it is the right time,"" he said. ""She won the Aussie Open for everyone and I don't think there's anything left in the tank for her.""
He said it was at the Olympics in Tokyo - which followed Barty's Wimbledon win - that ""the motivation wasn't really there"".
Barty's retirement means Poland's 20-year-old Iga Swiatek is likely to become world number one when the rankings are updated next week.
Swiatek is the first player since Caroline Wozniacki in 2009 to win five or more titles before the age of 21.
Barty said: ""If it is Iga, there is no better person. She's an incredible person, a great tennis player. The way that she's brought this fresh, fearless energy on to the court has been incredible.
""She thoroughly deserves it. I hope that she can take it and still be her, do it her own way, and really chase what she's after in her career and her dreams.""
'Disbelief' and 'no regrets' - how the players reacted
Barty's retirement was met with surprise and praise from across the sport.
""I can't lie. I was sad to read your decision but also happy for your new chapter,"" 23-time Grand Slam singles champion Serena Williams wrote on Twitter. ""Always your fan close up and afar. Sending all my love.""
Former world number one Naomi Osaka said being away from home on tour for most of 2021 ""certainly took a toll"" on Barty, adding she can ""leave with no regrets"".
Britain's reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu said Barty's retirement illustrated ""how personal everyone's objectives and goals are"".
""I feel like if I set out with a goal when I'm starting to play tennis, once I'm happy, it kind of makes sense to finish on a high,"" Raducanu said.
Stefanos Tsitsipas said he watched Barty's retirement video ""in disbelief"".
""I couldn't believe what I just saw,"" Tsitsipas said.
""Honestly she's at the peak of her game right now. I knew she would want to take a break after the Australian Open, which I guess is normal. Didn't expect it to be coming any time soon.""
A different kind of ambition
Simon Atkinson, BBC News, Brisbane
Even in retirement Ash Barty says she'll still be ""hitting tennis balls"", just no longer for the ""selfish"" reason of progressing her career.
And that's exciting for the boys and girls who stand to benefit from her coaching and expertise. Many have credited Barty for getting them into the game.
Chatting to young players at the Queensland Tennis Centre after Wednesday's shock announcement, I was struck by how much they appreciated Barty's spirit and determination as much as her famed backhand slice.
Media caption,
Shocked, stunned, proud: Watch for reaction from players at the Brisbane tennis centre where Barty trained
Georgia Campbell, the state's under-14 clay-court champion, excitedly recalled the time she got Barty's autograph, but said the player had also given her something more important - inspiration to train hard, never give up and have fun.
As a proud Aboriginal woman, Barty is keen to give particular focus to working with young Indigenous Australians, and helping them fulfil their potential on and off the court. Her recent visit to communities in the Northern Territory is something she wants to do ""much more of"".
Such community-minded ambition doesn't make for great headlines, but as 'Ash Barty the athlete' morphs into 'Ash Barty the person' there are few complaints here.
Barty became world number one in 2019, a position she held for 114 consecutive weeks since then.
Only Steffi Graf, Serena Williams (both 186 weeks) and Martina Navratilova (156) have enjoyed longer streaks as world number one in the women's game.
Williams is the only other active female player to have won major titles on clay, grass and hard courts, and at the time of her retirement Barty had earned $23.8m (£17.9m) in prize money.
Her Australian Open win cemented her reputation as a national hero."
Sports,"Ashleigh Barty retires: Her time at the top was too short for tennis - but not for her
Barty celebrates winning the Australian Open title in January
Ashleigh Barty's ambitions and desires have been well and truly sated. Her time at the top was too short for tennis, but not for the person who matters most.
If winning Wimbledon was the Holy Grail, then enduring fulfilment was secured in January when Barty became the first home winner of an Australian Open singles title for 44 years.
""I [no longer] have the physical drive, the emotional want,"" the 25 year old has said.
""I just know that I'm absolutely spent.""
Perhaps the decision has been accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, with its enforced bubble life and the difficulties of returning home to Australia.
World number one Barty retires to ""chase other dreams""
The Sports Desk podcast: Retirement in sport and Tom Brady's U-turn
Barty spent six months on the road last year and, in 2014 as an 18-year-old, she suffered home sickness and depression before taking a two-year break from the tour.
But surprising though the announcement is, with Barty in her 121st week as world number 1, the Queenslander never seemed likely to be playing into her 30s.
She is never happier than at home near Brisbane, with family and friends - barbecue tongs in one hand and a cold beer in the other.
There are many parallels to the decision taken by Justine Henin in May 2008.
She was also 25, world number one, and had won two Grand Slams in the previous 12 months. The announcement of her retirement, just two weeks before the French Open which the Belgian had won for the previous three years, was a monumental surprise.
But, like Barty, she also said she had given everything and wanted to try her hand at something new.
Henin, though, came back for more. Motivated by Roger Federer completing his set of Grand Slams at Roland Garros in 2009, she wanted to see whether she could win Wimbledon, which would remain the only major title to elude her.
The only Grand Slam singles title missing from Barty's resume is the US Open. Only 10 women in history - and only Margaret Court, Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova in the Open Era - have been able to win all four Slams.
Could Barty one day be tempted? It is always possible, of course, but she seems to me to be a less likely candidate for a comeback.
And I do not say that because of the conditions at the US Open, although Barty's long-serving coach Craig Tyzzer made some interesting observations about that at this year's Australian Open.
""The US Open really needs to change the ball for the girls. It's a terrible ball for someone like Ash - the ball itself is so light,"" he said.
""I had to change her racquet just to get any sort of control of the ball. If they keep that ball the same, no-one like Ash will win that tournament.""
When returning to tennis in 2016, after playing professional cricket for Brisbane Heat in the inaugural women's Big Bash League, Barty admitted having missed the competition and the one-on-one battles.
Her fiancée, Garry Kissick, is a trainee golf professional, and given Barty's low single figure handicap, there is sure to be further speculation about her one day embarking on a third professional sport. Once, that is, she has enjoyed ""the next phase of life as Ash Barty the person, not Ash Barty the athlete"".
It is unusual for players to retire so young when injuries are not a factor. Jennifer Capriati had well-documented off-court issues, but the initial retirements, in their 20s, of Tracy Austin, Martina Hingis and Marion Bartoli were predominantly caused by ailing bodies.
Barty's departure makes you even more grateful for the longevity of the Williams sisters - and concerned for the short term future of the WTA Tour.
The 2020 French Open champion Iga Swiatek is likely to take over as world number 1 after the Miami Open - but only if Barty asks for her name to be removed from the rankings. Maria Sakkari, Barbora Krejcikova and Aryna Sabalenka are the other current members of the top five - and their achievements are not yet widely celebrated outside the sport.
Naomi Osaka is also playing sparingly, but there are plenty of reasons for long-term optimism in the shape of teenagers Emma Raducanu, Coco Gauff and Leylah Fernandez.
To lose a player like Barty, who has won 25 of her last 26 matches on the tour and been world number 1 for the past 114 weeks, leaves a gaping hole though.
She has become the reference point for women's tennis, having carried herself with class and provided inspiration for indigenous communities.
And Barty has charmed us with the grace of her truly beautiful game."
Sports,"Miami Open: Emma Raducanu loses in second round as Heather Watson advances
Britain's Emma Raducanu suffered another early exit as she was beaten by Katerina Siniakova in the second round of the Miami Open.
Raducanu served for the match in the third set but ultimately lost 3-6 6-4 7-5 to the erratic Czech.
The US Open champion, 19, has won just two of her seven matches this season.
Earlier, compatriot Heather Watson claimed her first win over a top-20 player since 2020 with a 4-6 6-3 7-6 (7-4) victory over Elina Svitolina.
Watson saved a match point on her way to victory over the 20th-ranked Ukrainian.
It is the first time in six years that Watson has reached the third round in Miami.
""I love this tournament. I've been coming here for so long, I feel like it's home,"" Watson told Amazon Prime.

'Barty's time at the top too short - but not for her'
Raducanu, seeded 11th, will be left to rue her missed chances - she converted just five of 17 break points and looked to be affected by nerves as she attempted to serve out the match.
She started the stronger of the two and raced to a 4-1 lead, with a tearful Siniakova taking a medical time-out for what appeared to be a rib problem.
After closing out the first set, Raducanu raced to a break lead in the second before the world number 53 forced a decider.
Raducanu again took a break lead early in the third set and had a chance to go 3-0 up before Siniakova reeled off three games in a row.
Despite this, Raducanu broke and served for the match at 5-4, but a double fault handed the initiative back to Siniakova.
The Czech, ranked number one in women's doubles, was then able to take advantage of a visibly disappointed Raducanu to close out victory.
Watson bounces back for big win
Heather Watson is currently 115 in the world rankings
Watson has dropped out of the top 100 and has opted to miss Britain's Billie Jean King Cup tie with the Czech Republic in April to focus on her singles ranking.

She saved a match point as she served to take the deciding set to a tie-break before reeling off three points in a row to claim victory.
""I'm really happy that I'm coming back into form this year,"" Watson added.
""I was just thinking at the end that my fitness got me through that match. I'm really glad I held my nerve and was able to get over the line.""
Watson will face either 22nd seed Belinda Bencic or Marta Kostyuk next.
Earlier, Naomi Osaka thrashed Angelique Kerber in a meeting of two former world number ones.
Japan's Osaka needed just 60 minutes to beat the 15th-seeded German 6-2 6-3.

She will face Karolina Muchova next after the Czech beat US Open runner-up Leylah Fernandez 6-4 7-6 (7-3) in their second-round encounter.

Poland's Iga Swiatek will become the first player born in the 2000s to become world number one
Poland's Iga Swiatek says becoming world number one is ""surreal"" after a second-round win in Miami that means she will take the mantle from Ashleigh Barty, who has retired from the sport.
Three-time Grand Slam winner Barty, 25, announced her shock retirement earlier this week, saying she would ""chase other dreams"" instead.
She had been world number one for 114 consecutive weeks.
Swiatek, 20, is the first Polish player to top the rankings.
""I never really imagined that moment because, truth to be told, I was working day-by-day and playing tennis well,"" Swiatek said.
""But I never had the strong belief that it can actually happen. So, it's even more surreal for me.""
After winning the Indian Wells title last week - which took her to number two in the world - Swiatek extended her career-best 12-match winning streak with a 6-2 6-0 win against Viktorija Golubic of Switzerland in the Miami Open.
The victory guaranteed Swiatek, who burst to prominence by winning the 2020 French Open, would take over from Barty when the new ranking is released on 4 April.
Speaking about the prospect of Swiatek becoming number one following her retirement, Barty said: ""If it is Iga, there is no better person. She's an incredible person, a great player. The way she's brought this fresh, fearless energy on to the court has been incredible.

Sports,"Rafael Nadal beaten by Taylor Fritz in Indian Wells final
Nadal had won 20 consecutive matches before losing to Fritz in California
Rafael Nadal says he suffered from breathing difficulties during his straight sets defeat by Taylor Fritz in the Indian Wells final.
Nadal, 35, appeared out of sorts and quickly found himself 4-0 down before leaving the court for treatment.
He looked more comfortable on his return but struggled to break down a determined Fritz who won 6-3 7-6 (7-5).
""It's tough for me to breathe. When I try to breathe, it's painful and it's very uncomfortable,"" said Nadal.
""When I'm breathing, when I'm moving it's like a needle all the time inside here. I get dizzy a little bit because it's painful. It's a kind of pain that limits me a lot. It's not only about pain, I don't feel very well because it affects my breathing.""
Spaniard Nadal, who claimed victory at the Australian Open earlier this year, had won his previous 20 matches in 2022.
But he made 34 unforced errors in the match compared to 22 from Fritz.
""Honestly I am sad because of the way I was not able to compete,"" he added. ""The thing that worries me now, it's about what's going on there, what I have to do now to recover and how long it's going to take.""
Fritz's win meant he became the first American to win at Indian Wells since Andre Agassi in 2001.
He saved two break points at 5-5 in the second set before winning a tie-break to secure his second ATP Tour title - and first Masters 1000 victory.
There were concerns about his fitness after he suffered an ankle injury in the semi-final win against Andrey Rublev but he showed no ill-effects during his win.
""I can't even begin to describe how ridiculous it is to play, how I could play today, I've never experienced worse pain like I did before the match,"" said 24-year-old Fritz.
""I took a couple of steps and screamed. I was trying to act tough and we did a lot of work leading up to the match.
""I was really upset, basically almost crying because I thought I was going to have to pull out.
""I went through a rollercoaster of emotion and all of a sudden being really happy thinking maybe I can play, but it didn't affect me at all.
""This is one of those childhood dreams you never even think will come true.""
Analysis by BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller
Rafael Nadal confessed to being both sad and worried as his 2022 unbeaten run came to an end.
The sadness stems from not being able to complete a perfect hard court season; the worry from just not knowing how this as yet undiagnosed injury may affect his clay court season.
But what a performance from Taylor Fritz after fearing he would not even be able to take to the court.
His blistering start to the match was perhaps a sign of a man who did not know how long his ankle would last. But he soon realised he was in much better shape than he could possibly have imagined and was able to clinch the title in a very tight and tense second set tiebreak.
This tall and powerful former junior world number 1 is rapidly heading into the world's top 10 - which is his next stated goal."

Osaka's second-round exit at Indian Wells is the earliest she has been knocked out of a tournament since returning from an indefinite break that began last year after her US Open title defence ended in the third round.
That break was her second of the year, after she withdrew from the French Open amid controversy over her wish not to speak to the media after matches, and revealed she has struggled with her mental health since first becoming a Grand Slam champion in 2018.
The 24-year-old also missed Wimbledon before returning to the sport later in the summer at the Tokyo Olympics, where she lit the flame at the opening ceremony."

Oleksandr Usyk (left) beat Anthony Joshua by unanimous decision in September
Saudi Arabia could host the Oleksandr Usyk-Anthony Joshua rematch in late June, according to the Ukrainian's promoter Alexander Krassyuk.
Usyk is set to face Briton Joshua after beating him last year to be crowned unified heavyweight champion.
""Saudi is the place we are in discussions with at the moment,"" Krassyuk told BBC Sport.
""Late June is the date we are looking at. Nothing has been confirmed on paper. We are working on it.""
While Saudi Arabia is believed to be the front runner, Krassyuk has not ruled out the rematch taking place elsewhere.
""There are other options but we take it step by step,"" he added.
A fight in Saudi Arabia is likely to provoke controversy, with the country accused of investing in sport and using high-profile events to 'sports wash' its reputation in other parts of the world amid concerns over its human rights record.
Joshua could return to Saudi Arabia having regained his world title belts by beating Mexican Andy Ruiz Jr in the capital Riyadh in December 2019, after being knocked out by the Mexican in a shock knockout defeat six months earlier.
Usyk won the WBA, WBO and IBF belts from Joshua on a unanimous points decision at London's Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in September.
The rematch with Joshua, 32, had initially been targeted for May but was pushed back after Usyk enlisted in Ukraine's military in March following the Russian invasion.
The 35-year-old left his native Ukraine, where he had been helping to defend the country, on 23 March.
He confirmed the rematch two days later in an Instagram post, saying: ""I decided to start preparing for a rematch with Anthony Joshua.""
Why is hosting sport in Saudi Arabia so controversial?
The Gulf Kingdom state's human rights record and recent security concerns will once again be highlighted should such a high-profile sporting event be hosted in the country.
Britain's seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton repeated his call for Saudi Arabia to improve its human rights record before last weekend's Grand Prix in Jeddah. The race went ahead despite a missile attack about nine miles from the track on Friday.
Premier League club Newcastle were bought last year by a group led by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, prompting concern.
The use of the death penalty, jailing of women's rights activists, punishment of same-sex relationships and a military campaign in neighbouring Yemen are among the reasons why Saudi Arabia's involvement in sport has been criticised."
Sports,"Small Hall Spotlight: 'If I win this belt, maybe I can forget about being homeless' - The home town fighter's struggle
Dean Dodge struggles to makes ends meet as the home corner fighter
After the last Small Hall Spotlight showed the journeyman perspective, this month focuses on the home corner.
What is it like to turn professional and try to build a career on the small hall circuit? How hard is it to reach the promised land of televised shows, title fights and big money?
In what will be his 12th pro contest, Yeovil's Dean Dodge makes his second attempt at winning the Southern Area championship on 22 April, at London's York Hall. Currently living in a hostel for rough sleepers, he believes a win there can be the start of better things.
Dodge's situation may be particularly acute, but his boxing journey bears similarities to most early career fighters, known as 'prospects' in the trade.
Since discovering boxing as an eleven-year-old, amassing a 47-fight amateur card, then turning pro at 22 with Birmingham trainer Jon Pegg, Dodge's career has revolved around ticket sales, day jobs, health concerns and other uncertainties. Despite that, he professes a deep, undying passion for the sport.
""It might sound funny,"" he says. ""But there's something about getting hit. I actually love getting hit. I love what it does to me, and I love having a war. I love everything about boxing. I guess you have to, to want to do this.""
Small Hall Spotlight: Skills don't pay the bills - tickets do
Does boxing needs to change after Taylor v Catterall judging controversy?
Pro fighters from Yeovil are something of a rarity, meaning the announcement of Dodge's professional debut in 2016 caused considerable local fanfare. The accompanying publicity helped him sell over 100 tickets, although the bout was scheduled to take place in Bournemouth, 50miles away.
""Obviously, the distance makes it harder,"" he says. ""When people know they've got to drive an hour and a half to the show, they're more reluctant to support you. But I'm always putting messages out. I even put ads in newspapers, and generally make a pest of myself. I graft to sell because I know it's important.""
Dodge trained hard and got his weight down but was to suffer bitter disappointment when his pre-fight brain scan turned up an anomaly. His license was suspended, and the contest cancelled.
""The boxing board said I might have an aneurysm, which was a scary thing to hear. They needed a second opinion from a doctor,"" Dodge explains. ""But it was down to me to organise it and it took about a year, getting appointments with specialists and going back and forth.
""In the end it was just luck, really. I met a girl on Tinder whose dad happened to be a neurologist, and he helped me get it sorted.""
The entire episode, which caused Dodge huge stress and led to his first period of homelessness after falling out with his mother, had been caused by a benign fatty deposit. Once correctly diagnosed, his license was reinstated, and he won a rearranged debut against seasoned journeyman Kristian Laight in September 2017.
He then embarked on a three-year, nine-fight unbeaten run, yet his struggles outside the ring went on.
""I've had several spells of homelessness,"" Dodge says. ""It's something that's followed me throughout my twenties, and of course it affects me.
""I often seem to be sofa surfing or sleeping in my car. I've had jobs, working in factories or labouring, but it's hard to make ends meet. I've never really had any money and people think you get well paid as a fighter, but it's not true. If you can't get big sponsorship deals, then you're working full time and training, which really isn't easy.
""You feel like you're caught between two worlds.
""My best night financially was when I boxed in my hometown (against Lee Connelly in 2019) and I sold 350 tickets. It's shame I can't box in Yeovil more often, but it's not a big boxing place.
""Other than that, it's been heavy going at times. For example, when I boxed Nathan Kirk, in my sixth fight [in Bournemouth] it was just before Christmas, and it was tough to get people out.
""I didn't shift as many tickets as usual. I had to pay Nathan £1,300 as my opponent, and that left me with £200. I knocked him out, as well and you're thinking - I trained for months for this. This doesn't add up.""
The Yeovil man then took his first crack at the Southern Area super-featherweight title. But by the time he boxed Sidcup's Danny Carr in Bolton, under lockdown conditions in February 2021, economic realities had again taken their toll.
""I don't want to make excuses, but I had been living at my girlfriend's place. Then we split up, so I ended up sleeping in my car again,"" he remembers.
""That was five weeks before the fight, which obviously messed up my preparation. I don't want to take anything away from my opponent. He boxed well and deserved it, but I wasn't in a good state.""
A period of depression followed, and Dodge admits succumbing to dark thoughts. His first professional loss, the ending of his relationship and the continued insecurity of his housing status were a lot to bear.
Now finally settled, with a steady place in a hostel, he has refocused on his boxing.
Dodge has been training in Wales with former world light-welterweight champion Gavin Rees. Large framed for a super-featherweight, with power in both hands, the 28-year-old feels he is much better positioned to take his opportunity this time.
""What happened last year put everything in perspective,"" he says. ""It was a learning experience.
""Now I just need to win this belt. If I win it, I can forget about being homeless and forget about all those bad nights, at least for a while. I will feel like I'm turning the corner. It will all be worth it."""
Sports,"Josh Warrington beats Kiko Martinez to regain IBF featherweight title with KO win
By Kal SajadBBC Sport at First Direct Arena
Last updated on27 March 202227 March 2022.From the sectionBoxing
Highlights: Josh Warrington knocks out Kiko Martinez to regain IBF featherweight title
Briton Josh Warrington sensationally knocked out Spain's Kiko Martinez in the seventh round to become a two-time IBF featherweight champion.
In front of his loyal home fans at First Direct Arena in Leeds, the 31-year-old dropped the Spaniard in the first round before the fight was halted two minutes 12 seconds into the seventh.
The two fighters previously met in 2017, Warrington edging a close points decision, but this time the 'Leeds Warrior' won in clinical fashion.
It was Warrington's first win since October 2019 as he regains the title he held between 2018 and January 2021. He seemed to hurt his hand in the fight and was also later taken to hospital with a suspected fractured jaw.
Josh Warrington: IBF featherweight champion wants to fight in United States
""Kiko [is] still not finished. He's a big puncher,"" Warrington told BBC Radio 5 Live in his post-fight interview. ""He's got iron in both hands and he didn't stop coming.
""I've done the same hands what I did in the first fight on his head. Around three or four, I lost feeling in my hands. It was getting to the stage when every time I hit him I went numb.""
As it happened: Martinez v Warrington II
Electric atmosphere, fast start and clinical finish
The First Direct Arena has become synonymous with the 'Leeds Warrior' - it is the 11th time Warrington has headlined at the venue.
Keeping to tradition, he once again walked to the ring to Marching On Together, the Leeds United anthem, followed by I Predict A Riot by Leeds-based indie band Kaiser Chiefs.
Leeds United footballer Luke Ayling accompanied Warrington to the ring, with team-mate Kalvin Phillips at ringside.
Warrington started quick out of the blocks, and midway through the round unleashed a barrage of shots to head and body. Moments later, a vicious right hook then connected flush on the champion and Martinez hit the canvas.
Martinez picked up a nasty cut in the first few rounds
He rose to his feet and, with Warrington sensing an early finish, somehow withstood the subsequent onslaught. Clearly frustrated by a poor start and hampered by a cut to the left eye, Martinez riled his opponent and the crowd by punching Warrington after the bell.
As 'Yorkshire, Yorkshire, Yorkshire' echoed around the arena, Warrington threw a combination of left and right hooks which again troubled Martinez in the second.
A bloodied Martinez was undeterred. He landed a solid right in the fourth as both fighters traded hooks and uppercuts.
More damage was being done to Martinez's face and while the Spaniard was enjoying some success and seemingly fully recovered from that first-round knockdown, he was now cut above both eyes.
As the fight progressed, there was a feeling at ringside that the tempo was starting to slow down, but Warrington had other ideas.
Having just been caught by a right, Warrington returned with ferocious shots which landed from all angles. With Martinez backed up on the ropes and throwing little back, referee Marcus McDonnell had little choice but to intervene.
Back to the big time
A look back at Kiko Martinez and Josh Warrington's fights in 2021
It was the manner of Warrington's win which will be most pleasing for him and his trainer and father, Sean O'Hagan.
Very few boxing careers culminate without trials, tribulations and setbacks. While tougher tests await, the victory marks a return to winning ways and world champion status for Warrington after arguably the most frustrating, and disappointing period of his 13-year professional career.
After beating Wales' Lee Selby for the IBF title, he made consecutive defences against former world champion Carl Frampton and future world champion Kid Galahad.
Then after a period of inactivity during the coronavirus pandemic, in which Warrington fought just once in 16 months, he suffered a first career defeat after a shock knockout loss to Mauricio Lara in February 2021.
Admirably, he went straight into a rematch with the hard-hitting Mexican six months later - only for the fight to be declared a technical draw in the second round because of an accidental clash of heads.
The phrase ""must-win fight"" is used far too often in boxing, but a loss to Martinez would have almost certainly derailed Warrington's hopes of regaining a world-title.
Unifications? Vegas away day?
Warrington had his friend and Leeds United star Luke Ayling with him for the fight
A unification fight with Nottingham's WBA regular champion Leigh Wood - who was in attendance - is perhaps the most likely outcome for Warrington, with both fighters signed to Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Boxing.
Wood's own stock rose dramatically when he knocked out Michael Conlan in the 12th round earlier this month, having been down in the fight and on the judges' scorecards.
A blockbuster all-British clash looks destined for a stadium fight at either Leeds United's Elland Road or Nottingham Forest's City Ground, featuring two football-loving fighters who would bring huge city-based support.
Warrington has also stated he has unfinished business with Lara. It is a risky rematch he does not have to take, but will speak volumes of his character should he do so.
Mexican Emanuel Navarrete is the WBO champion and Mark Magsayo from the Philippines holds the WBC belt, so a unification contest against either fighter is also a possibility.
Another option could be a high-profile bout against WBA 'super' champion Leo Santa Cruz, although the Mexican has not competed at featherweight in three years.
Warrington has a preference, but seems to be keeping his options open.
""In an ideal world I'd love to go to the States,"" he said. ""But Leigh Wood's just become champion. I'd like an away day. But I love it here.""
Promoter Hearn added: ""Josh has long wanted a trip to America and it would be Ricky Hatton-esque if we could do it.""
Whoever he faces next, Warrington will for now bask in the glory of his latest win. Before the fight, he said his yet-to-be-written autobiography has already gone from bargain aisle to best seller. But hold print. There is still, at least, another chapter to be penned."
Sports,"Lee Selby beat Russia's Evgeny Gradovich to claim the IBF featherweight title at the O2 Arena in London in 2015
Welsh boxer Lee Selby has hinted he could retire after losing by stoppage for the first time in his career at the hands of Gustavo Lemos in Argentina.
Selby was hoping for a chance to win a world title at lightweight, with this bout a final eliminator for the IBF lightweight title.
However, Selby, 34, was stopped in the fifth round by Lemos, who also floored the Welshman in the fourth round.
Lemos should now get a chance to fight champion George Kambosos Jr.
There will be a feeling of what have been for Selby, a former IBF featherweight world champion, who lost a split decision to Kambosos in a lightweight fight at Wembley Arena in October 2020.
Victory in that fight would have set up a huge bout and massive payday against American Teofimo Lopez, who was beaten on a split decision in New York in November by Kambosos Jr, who won the WBA, WBO and IBF lightweight belts.
Selby was bidding for the opportunity to become the first two-weight world champion from Wales, but was never able to dominate his unbeaten opponent at Luna Park in Buenos Aires.
Selby, 28-4, has now lost three of his last five fights, since Josh Warrington won his world featherweight title at Elland Road in 2018.
The Welsh boxer did mark his opponent in an even first round, before Lemos began to dominate, hurting Selby at the end of the third round and forcing him to take a knee in the fourth, before another flurry of unanswered punches in the fifth sent Selby to the canvas again, with the referee stepping in to wave off proceedings.
""A tough loss to take but sadly time waits for no man,"" Selby wrote on social media. ""Getting hard to go toe to toe with these young guns 10 years my junior.
""Thanks for all the support back home, I'm all OK.
""Congratulations to Gustavo Lemos on the victory."""
Sports,"Oleksandr Usyk v Anthony Joshua: Heavyweight champion confirms rematch preparations
Oleksandr Usyk (left) beat Anthony Joshua by unanimous decision in September
Heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk has confirmed he is preparing for a rematch with Britain's Anthony Joshua.
Usyk is set to face Joshua in June after his victory last year saw him crowned unified heavyweight champion.
The 35-year-old left his native Ukraine, where he had been helping to defend the country from the Russian invasion, on Wednesday.
""I decided to start preparing for a rematch with Anthony Joshua,"" Usyk posted on Instagram on Friday.
Usyk won the WBA, WBO IBF and IBO belts from Joshua on a unanimous points decision in London in September.
The rematch with Joshua had initially been targeted for May but was pushed back following the Russian invasion.
Usyk enlisted in Ukraine's military in March following the Russian invasion.
A banner reading ""Hands off Ukraine, Putin!"" could be seen behind Usyk in his Instagram video.
""A large number of my friends support me, all the rest of the good and peace, thank God for everything,"" he wrote."
Sports,"Caroline Dubois: 'There's no rush, I can't be beating everyone now, can I?
Caroline Dubois has her second pro fight this weekend
Caroline Dubois is in no rush to become the future superstar she is being hailed as.
The 21-year-old boxer fights in her second pro bout on Saturday in London, with her promoter Ben Shalom describing her ""the next face of women's boxing"".
But Dubois, who is a decorated amateur and fought at last summer's Tokyo Olympics, is in no hurry to live up to her billing.
""There's no rush, I can't be beating everyone now, can I?"" she tells BBC Sport.
""It's crazy people are already throwing out things like that but it's cool because they have that belief in me.
""I haven't even stepped up yet and they're already saying I can do all these things. I want to prove them right and make them feel they made a good investment.""
Dubois made her pro debut under a huge spotlight in February on the undercard of Chris Eubank's fight against Liam Williams in Cardiff. Multiple-weight world champion Claressa Shields was also on the card.
""I wasn't overwhelmed,"" says Dubois, who fought at super-bantamweight on her debut.
""I look at Claressa and it helps me decide what kind of fighter I want to be and what kind of person I want to be.
""She's outspoken and she takes up a lot of the attention because she's not afraid to say how good she is. I felt that was really cool.
""Seeing her train and seeing how she carried herself, it rubbed off on me. I was able to learn from her.""
Does boxing need to change after Taylor v Catterall controversy?

Watching Shields demolish Ema Kozin and then go toe-to-toe with WBO middleweight champion Savannah Marshall at ringside was inspiring for Dubois, who says she is still figuring out exactly what kind of fighter - and woman - she wants to be.
""At the end of the day, people just copy each other and we're constantly looking at other people for inspiration and she's definitely somebody who inspires me,"" she says.
""Pro boxing, it's all the time. Everyone wants to interview you all the time. It can be a bit much and overwhelming, so you really need the right people around you. You need to keep your focus. I'm doing that with the right people. But it's still something you have to learn to deal with.""
One of the people around Dubois is her brother and fellow boxer Daniel, who turned pro as a heavyweight when he was just 19.
The siblings are both trained by Shane McGuigan and travel to the gym together.
""There's no competition there. There's no way I'm squatting what he is,"" Dubois jokes.
Report
But one piece of advice from her brother has stuck with Caroline.
""He's told me to be myself,"" she says. ""And it's better to be open and speak your mind.""
Dubois might have a bright future ahead of her, and although she says the leap from novice to world title contender is shorter than in the men's game, the Londoner is keen to take things slowly.
""I want to learn and improve, I know I'm still very immature,"" she says. ""I don't need anyone to tell me that so I want to develop as a person as much as a boxer.
""I want to have five, six bouts by the end of this year. I want them to be all learning fights, learning the game, learning the ropes, learning the lights.
""We're in no rush. Female boxing, the level isn't the same. You have the beginner level and then, bam, you could be fighting for a world title.
""You have to be ready when the time comes, but right now I'm still young and there's no rush."""
Sports,"Olympic medallist Pat McCormack lands stoppage win on pro debut
McCormack won Olympic silver in 2021 before joining the professional ranks
Olympic silver medallist Pat McCormack launched his professional career with a first-round stoppage of Justin Menzie.
McCormack, 26, delivered a devastating right hook to the body of the 38-year-old just one minute and 38 seconds into the six-round bout in Newcastle.
The British welterweight said: ""I told you if I smelt blood I was going to take it and I've got a first-round stoppage, so I couldn't be happier.
""To become a world champion, that's what I'm in for.""
Speaking to Eurosport, the decorated amateur added: ""I wanted to become Olympic champion, but I didn't get it, I got silver, but I'm going for world champion next. It's going to be a few years down the line, obviously.
""I'm going to move at the pace I need to move at. We'll take the big fights when they come. We're going to sell out this arena one day, and St James' Park as well.""
The president of fight promoter Probellum Boxing, Richard Schaefer, recently said McCormack can follow in the footsteps of Mexico's Canelo Alvarez and become the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world.
And the north-east fighter made short work of Britain's Menzie, who holds a record of five wins, six defeats and a draw.
Earlier in the night at Newcastle's Utilita Arena, Troy Williamson survived a knockdown to out-point Mason Cartwright and retain his British super-welterweight title in a thrilling fight.
Williamson, 30, was sent to the canvas in round two by the challenger, 29, but prevailed 116-111, 117-112 and 114-113 on the judges' scorecards."
Sports,"Does boxing need to change after Josh Taylor v Jack Catterall controversy?
Josh Taylor beat Jack Catterall by a controversial split decision
Controversy can sometimes be a catalyst for change in sport, but the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) investigation into last month's Josh Taylor v Jack Catterall world super-lightweight title fight has created more questions than answers.
Scotland's Taylor clung on to his WBA, WBC, IBF and WBO belts with a split-decision victory in Glasgow, after English challenger Taylor looked to have claimed a stunning upset in the home fighter's first defence.
Two judges scored in favour of Taylor, who was floored in the eighth round, and delivered a verdict met with widespread disbelief which the Catterall camp called ""disgusting"".
Judge Ian John-Lewis had Taylor winning the bout by three rounds, and after a review the BBBofC downgraded him from an 'A star' class referee to an 'A', meaning he can no longer officiate world title contests.
Yet in the accompanying statement, the BBBofC claimed to be ""satisfied that Mr John-Lewis' scorecard did not affect the overall result"".
Catterall's trainer, Nigel Travis, remains far from satisfied.
""I find it a ludicrous outcome,"" Travis told BBC Sport. ""They're just using Ian John-Lewis as a scapegoat. Yes, his scorecard was poor, but that doesn't tell the whole story. The idea that his scorecard didn't affect the outcome is just mental. I don't know what to say.
""He was one of three judges and it was a split decision. How could it not affect the outcome?
Judge 'downgraded' after controversial Taylor v Catterall scorecards

Taylor hits out at 'personal attacks' since win against Catterall
""I have a problem with all the scorecards of that fight. The board talk about subjectivity, that it's natural for judges to see things individually, but that doesn't explain it at all for me.
""Even the judge who gave it to Jack [Howard Foster] only gave it by one round, when it was clearly more convincing than that, so all three of them have favoured Taylor, in my opinion.
""It was a huge event, people watching around the world, and the officials have shown themselves to be either incapable, incompetent or - and I hesitate to use the word - corrupt.""
British boxing great, Duke McKenzie MBE, a three-weight world champion who now works as a pundit and runs a gym in South London, was similarly scathing.
""The board's findings don't go far enough,"" McKenzie said. ""Really, here the British Boxing Board of Control are investigating themselves, aren't they?
""It shouldn't work like that. They appointed all three judges, so downgrading one official doesn't cut any slack. It doesn't.
""I think there needs to be an investigation by the world bodies into that fight. We need to look at the way officials are appointed. Steps need to be taken to make sure judges are neutral.""
Taylor 'put too much pressure' on himself in Catterall defence
Corruption or incompetence?
There is a growing feeling that the tendency for controversial decisions to be awarded to the home fighter is an issue boxing must address for the sport to move on. Taylor v Catterall is the latest in a long line of examples.
""Of course corruption exists,"" trainer Travis said. ""At a big event the judges are wined and dined by the promoter. It's a business, isn't it? You have to remember there were actually two promoters that night - Boxxer and Top Rank.
""We had a lot of contact with Boxxer and [promoter] Ben Shalom, who seemed as upset as we were. I really respected Ben's honesty, saying afterwards he wanted to root this problem out.
""But will he be able to? I doubt it. Plans were already being made for Josh Taylor to go up in weight and box [WBO welterweight champion] Terence Crawford, so that probably helps to explain it.""
""The board should have declared it a no contest and ordered an immediate rematch,"" Travis went on. ""That would have been the only way to put things right. But they were never going to do that.""
Kevin Campion, director of operations at management and promotional company Goodwin Boxing feels a change of attitude is needed at the BBBofC; that there is a lack of accountability within an organisation which is able to investigate its own shortcomings.
""Firstly, I want to make it clear that I am a supporter of the BBBofC,"" Campion says. ""I believe they have an extremely difficult and thankless job to do. I also know some officials personally and they are good people.
""But I do also believe the BBBofC need to be more open about the steps that are being taken to stop this recurring, and make no mistake, this is a recurring issue in boxing. The first step to solving a problem is admitting that you have one.""
What can be done?
Catterall and his coach Nigel Travis were disgusted by the scorecards
A variety of potential solutions have been put forward in the wake of the Taylor v Catterall furore. The way fights are scored could potentially be adjusted, allowing judges more leeway to award extra points to a fighter who is dominating.
'Open scoring' is another possibility which has been trialled, in which judges' scorecards are displayed at ringside, reducing the risk of manipulation. Meanwhile, others have called for technology to be utilised, in the same way the video assistant referee (VAR) has become a regular feature of top-level football.
""I know fights can seem and look different from different sides of the ring,"" McKenzie says. ""So that could be something to think about. The system has to be tweaked, because we can't go on like this.""
""You have to look at this from a human point of view"" Travis reflects, with a sigh. ""It might be business, but it's wrong. This is about right and wrong, and Jack Catterall has been wronged. The board are trying to give themselves a way out and it's not right.""
The British Boxing Board of Control was approached for comment and its thoughts on potential reforms within boxing but did not respond."
Sports,"World IBF champion Sunny Edwards on proving he is the best, fighting Galal Yafai and unifying flyweight division
The most skilled boxer, pound-for-pound, in Britain might just be an 8st, 5ft 3in stylist from Croydon.
Sunny Edwards certainly thinks he is. ""Technically, almost definitely,"" he said of himself. ""Maybe blowing my own trumpet but technically I'm a nightmare.""
So far in his career, IBF flyweight champion Edwards has won almost all his fights well and widely. Saturday night was no different as he outpointed Muhammed Waseem.
""In all my fights that have gone the distance, which is pretty much every single one of them, I've never had one judge score a fight against me. Every one's been a unanimous decision, every one's usually very wide,"" he said.
""Why do you think I'm so confident? What evidence have I been given, in sparring as well, to suggest that anyone I'm ever in the ring with has surpassed my level? People get close to it, but no one ever blows me out of the water.""
Edwards, 26, has a particular style to his boxing. He moves deftly on his feet, using sharp reactions to dodge his opponent's shots and land his own quick counter-punches.
Edwards has shown that he can sustain that style for the full 12 rounds of a championship fight.
""I'm very hard to beat,"" he said. ""I'm not even easy to hit let alone beat. You don't have much of a chance if I don't let you.""
'A dream come true' - Parker to fight at Pride Park

But he's been working on something different too. A new style.
""I've got a lot to my toolbox and I keep showing them one thing,"" he said. ""I'm going through camps sparring a style different to what I'm fighting. Because I've mastered the hit-and-not-get hit for 12 rounds.
""People say that my sparring is the most intense sparring they've ever seen. I have wars in my spars. I have wars in my spars so I can go and have easy fights.""
He's been getting good people in for those spars. Edwards has been doing rounds with Galal Yafai, the Olympic flyweight gold medallist who has just turned professional.
Given that one day in the not too distant future Yafai will want to challenge Edwards for his world title, that is an unusual move.
""Not for me,"" Edwards insisted. ""I don't mind him having a look me and I'm sure he doesn't mind me having a look at him.
""He drags the fight out of you because of his relentless pressure.
""I'll be perfectly real, I want Galal to do as good and look as good as possible and if I can do anything, say anything, spar anything to help him achieve that level that I want him and expect him to get to, I will do it. Because he's like my return on investment right now.""
Edwards knows a fight between the two of them would be a big event.
""The moment that he wants it, he can have it,"" he said.
Galal Yafai has sparred with Edwards and turned pro earlier this year
""The moment Olympic gold medallist Galal, 'Golden Boy' Galal, wants to fight humble little old me that lost in the ABA final second time round and wasn't ever good enough to get sent anywhere for England [as an amateur] and always the third pick on GB, even though I knew I was the best then, I don't care.
""I'll fight anyone. Anyone that makes sense, I'll fight.""
Next Edwards wants to box Julio Cesar Martinez, the Mexican who now holds the WBC belt at flyweight.
They have some history. Edwards' older brother Charlie was a world champion who boxed Martinez in 2019.
The Mexican hurt and dropped him early on only for their bout to be ruled a no contest once Martinez had levelled him with an illegal blow while Charlie was on his knees.
Sunny, confident he can defuse the threat Martinez poses, wouldn't mind settling that score.
""Getting revenge is one thing but I remember that my brother was weight drained for that,"" he said.
""Luckily I've got my brother to look at because I've seen the times when he's really believed in himself, I've seen the result of it and I've also seen the times when he's not believed in himself and I've seen the result of that too.""
His vision is to unify titles in his division before moving up through the weights. Eventually he'll be going after all the big-name super-flyweights.
""I think I'm going to have a fun career. Even if sometimes I might bite off a little bit more than I can chew. I probably will at times because I believe in myself that much,"" Edwards said.
""I really want to see how great I am, because I don't know.
""But right now with everything that's laid out in front of me, how easy I found it to get to this point, everything I do in sparring, and how within myself everything seems to get to this level that I'm at right now, I could potentially be on for ridiculous greatness.
""I'm only going to find that out if I test it. What's the point of playing it safe?
""Try to be the best and go up weights and fight the best of the best. I can fall short and still come back.
""I don't know how great I am. I just know I'm really very good."""

""I want to be up there for young girls to look to me and think they can do this, this is a pathway they can follow.
""It's a massive step forward for women's boxing. It just shows how far women's boxing has come in the past few years.
""Now I've opened the door, the opportunities will keep coming. Promoters will see there are possibilities for women to be headlining big shows like this in amazing venues like the Hydro.""
Rankin, 31, beat American Sarah Curran to claim the IBO title in June 2019, earning a slice of Scottish boxing history, but lost the belt to Sweden's Patricia Berghult five months later.
The Luss fighter reclaimed the IBO crown and added the WBA title with victory over Berghult's compatriot Maria Lindberg in November.
She defends her belts for the first time against Mexican Ayala, 33, who has 14 wins in 19 professional fights.
""I've always wanted to fight a Mexican,"" Rankin told BBC Scotland. ""They're just fantastic fighters. They've got a history of being amazing boxers.
""I've often been nicknamed the Scottish Mexican - to fight a Mexican will be perfectly apt. You want to put on a show for the fans and there will be fireworks.
""I've been in with much more experienced opponents my whole career. I'm bigger, stronger, faster, and I'm looking forward to showcasing all of that on the night."""
Sports,"Saudi Arabian GP: A burgeoning rivalry between Charles Leclerc & Max Verstappen
Leclerc and Verstappen raced together in go-karts
Two races down in the new Formula 1 season, two fantastic battles between Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen.
The two 24-year-olds, the vanguards of the sport's new generation of drivers, staged a fight at turns tense and frantic as they played cat-and-mouse with each other and the various overtaking zones around the demanding and dangerous Jeddah track.
In the first race of the season, it was Leclerc who came out on top; in Saudi Arabia, it was Verstappen.
After pulling into the pit lane, the two drivers embraced, high on the adrenaline of their intense fight, and the season is so far giving the impression that it has the potential even to match the highs of Verstappen's fight with Lewis Hamilton last year.
But the excitement of the racing only went so far in being the distraction the sport's bosses had said they wanted from the overarching theme of the weekend - should F1 be racing in Saudi Arabia at all?

'Questions remain over racing in Saudi Arabia'
Max Verstappen wins after late overtake on Charles Leclerc
The politics question
There was a missile strike on a nearby oil factory during Friday practice, and the drivers at one point that evening had unanimously decided not to race.
They already had serious concerns over the safety of the track and the human rights issues that surround Saudi Arabia, and the fear of a missile hitting the track tipped them over the edge.
After four hours of meetings with a rolling cast of senior figures, the drivers were persuaded to climb down. And the longer the weekend went on, the more claims there were that the fear of ""what (could happen) if we don't race"" - as Alfa Romeo driver Valtteri Bottas put it - was involved.
Some even said that the drivers received unspecific warnings that there could be ""payback"" or ""repercussions"" if they took action.
F1 and governing body the FIA insist there was no talk of potential consequences in any of the meetings in which they were involved.
Through the weekend, it was very much a party line that the race went ahead because teams and drivers had been convinced by the Saudi authorities that the event was secure. But the drivers continued to be uneasy.
And that led to another party line. Any question as to whether F1 should race in Saudi Arabia again was met with the same response - we're going to talk about that later.
""We had a lot of guarantees we would be safe,"" Verstappen said after his victory, ""but I think after this weekend all the drivers together we will speak with F1 and the team bosses to see what's happening for the future.""
Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said: ""There wasn't any arm twisting from our side. There were good discussions. When the team principals talked to the drivers, what we talked was sense and not at all any pressure. But maybe that was perceived in a different way.
""In the end, the show and spectacle was amazing, and what we delivered as a sport was great. This is what sport should do and to be honest I have been (coming) here for five years. I have seen (societal) change. But there is just so much more to do. A lot.""
This is a reference to F1's justification for its involvement with Saudi - that it hopes its presence there can be a driver for change within the country. Not everyone buys that argument, of course, and Hamilton himself wondered aloud on Friday why change could not be faster.
F1's bosses - not just chairman Stefano Domenicali, but his bosses at Liberty Media, Greg Maffei and John Malone - now have some serious thinking to do.
Saudi Arabia pays F1 a lot of money. But having witnessed very clearly over the weekend the reputational risks that accompany it, people inside the sport are asking whether F1 can convincingly continue to push for diversity through its ""We Race As One"" campaign, while also selling the sport to the highest bidder.
Or, as one senior insider put it to BBC Sport, will they ""have to choose between profits and corporate responsibility""?
A cat-and-mouse fight
Verstappen took his first win of the season and 21st career victory
Last year, at the inaugural race on Jeddah's high-speed and formidable street circuit, the fight between Hamilton and Verstappen reached its bitterest low. Four months on, the contest between Verstappen and Leclerc was more about pure racing than gamesmanship and over-aggressive overtaking moves.
The race was given an extra dimension by Verstappen and Leclerc playing chicken with the DRS overtaking zones - trying not to be first going into the final corner, so they could get the speed boost from the DRS aid down the pit straight.
Some will have found it bordering on farcical at times, as the two drivers slammed on the brakes trying not to overtake each other. But Verstappen and Leclerc said they found it enjoyable.
""I definitely enjoyed the fight,"" Leclerc said. ""It's disappointing to lose the win so late in the race but it was a fun fight.
""It was very difficult because we had two cars in a very different place. I was very strong in the first sector in all the corners and much less strong in the straights.
""The point where we struggled the most was whenever Max got the DRS because our weaknesses were just bigger - the straight-line speed differences were bigger. We were still quick in the corners but not enough to have the margin to cover. From that moment onwards it was a bit more difficult for us.
""It was very tricky. I tried to have the DRS in the last corner. It worked twice but not the last time and then there was this yellow flag, where I could have had a chance to be alongside at least into Turn One, but I had no DRS there.
""This was a little bit of a shame. But it is part of the game.""
The brewing title battle
Verstappen's win was exactly what Red Bull needed after both cars retired with fuel-system problems within sight of the flag in Bahrain.
A first and a second for Leclerc in two races mean he has a 20-point lead over Verstappen, with the other Ferrari driver Carlos Sainz between them. But Red Bull are not too worried about that. As team principal Christian Horner joked afterwards: ""There are only 21 races to go.""
Already Leclerc and Verstappen look likely to be the men to contest this year's title, although Sainz has his own aspirations once he can get on top of this year's new cars.
Verstappen has been here before. For Leclerc, it is his first time in an F1 championship battle. That he has the speed and skill to take on Verstappen, though, is not in doubt.
""I am quite happy about the start, for sure,"" Leclerc said. ""I am working well with the team and the preparation for the first race was very good. I feel good in general but there is definitely more to come.
""The thing I am happy about is not really the performance but that I know exactly where I still need to work and what I need to improve to unlock more performance.
""I learn from my own experiences. I have my own style. I am quite strong in a wheel-to-wheel battle and you always try to be better.
""Max, I know him quite well, we have had some great battles in karting and we have grown up together, and it helped us grow in our own way.""
Ferrari have lost out on titles late in the season in 2017 and 2018
Ferrari's chance for redemption
This year is also a chance for Ferrari to bury some demons. The last time they were in title contention - with Sebastian Vettel, in 2017 and 2018 - they started both years with the fastest car, and kept it so for much of the year, only for their campaign to unravel following a series of mistakes from team and driver, and after Mercedes out-developed them.
This point was put to team principal Mattia Binotto after the race. And he nodded his agreement. He was not in charge of the team then; he was engine chief before being promoted for 2019. But he says Ferrari have learned from their experiences.
""Keeping up the level of development is always a challenge,"" Binotto said, ""but it's true that as well our competitors are very strong in that and as Ferrari in the last two opportunities we had in 2017 and '18 we lost a bit of ground in development.
""Since then, we have improved our tools - the wind tunnel, our methodologies and simulator - and we are much better prepared than in the past to do a better job in terms of development.
""But today we also have a budget cap which will influence the rate of development. We need to make sure we have the right policy on that because it could be a game changer in the fight, the development.""
Hamilton did not have a good race in Saudi
Will Mercedes join the fight?
Horner said after the race that he had ""no doubt (that) at some point Mercedes will join the battle"".
But the world champions themselves are not so sure about that. This was another difficult weekend for them. On pace, they are in no-man's land behind the top two teams and ahead of the rest, and that's where George Russell finished in fifth place.
Set-up problems relegated Hamilton to 15th on the grid. He was more competitive in the race, but still could manage only 10th, not helped by a mix-up about whether to pit just before the VSC was deployed.
The big concern for Mercedes is that they still don't have the answers they need to unlock the pace they believe they have in the car - and are still not sure it is there at all.
The Mercedes engine has lost its advantage over the rest. But it is the chassis where the most significant shortfalls lie, and if Leclerc and Verstappen keep sharing the wins, before long Hamilton will have an almost impossible amount of ground to make up.
Hamilton said after the race that a win ""feels like a long way away"", and that's how it looks for now."
Sports,"Saudi Arabian Grand Prix: Max Verstappen wins after late overtake on Charles Leclerc
Max Verstappen won an intense race-long battle with Charles Leclerc to take his first victory of the season in the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix.
The Red Bull driver passed the Ferrari with four laps to go after the two had duelled during a tense race.
The battle occasionally bordered on farce as the two slowed down almost to a stop at times to try to work the DRS overtaking zones to their advantage.
But Verstappen edged it by 0.5 seconds after making the decisive move.
The two were in a league of their own out front as Ferrari's Carlos Sainz and Red Bull's Sergio Perez took third and fourth.
George Russell finished fifth for Mercedes, ahead of Alpine's Esteban Ocon and McLaren's Lando Norris.
Lewis Hamilton recovered from starting 15th to finish 10th.
The excitement meant a difficult weekend for F1 ended on a high, but the drivers and other senior figures unnerved by Friday's missile strike on a nearby oil depot are unlikely to allow the sport's bosses to forget what has been an uncomfortable three days in the desert.
Verstappen took his first win of the season and 21st career victory
How did Verstappen come out on top?
Just two races into the season, it already feels as if this year could distil, like last one, into a two-horse race, with Leclerc replacing Hamilton as Verstappen's main rival.
Leclerc moved to the front after Ferrari appeared to trick Red Bull into making a pit stop with Perez, who started from pole and led the early laps.
A radio conversation asked Leclerc to ""push to box"" but he stayed out as Perez pitted. After the race, Leclerc said the team had agreed to do the opposite of Red Bull, who said their plan had always been to pit that lap. So Leclerc stayed out.
Ferrari's plan was now to run longer and make ground with what they hoped was Leclerc's extra pace.
But events came to Leclerc's aid as Nicholas Latifi crashed his Williams and brought out the safety car on the next lap, gifting Leclerc, Verstappen and Sainz a 'free' stop and dropping Perez down to the fourth place he would retain to the end.
Leclerc nailed the restart and retained the lead. For lap after lap, Verstappen trailed him, at about 1.5-second distance, but Leclerc appeared to be able to hold him at bay.
But a virtual safety car period with 12 laps to go changed the race, as a result of a bizarre sequence of events as first Daniel Ricciardo's McLaren and then Fernando Alonso's Alpine ground to a halt in the entry to the pit lane.
On the restart, Verstappen was suddenly on Leclerc's tail and the Ferrari driver could not shake him.
At first, Leclerc tried the same tactics that won him the first race of the season in Bahrain, letting Verstappen pass him at the end of one DRS overtaking zone - at the last corner in Jeddah - so he could have the boost from the DRS aid down the pit straight into Turn One.
That worked on lap 42 into lap 43, after which Leclerc set the fastest lap trying to break away from the Red Bull.
And the next time around, both slammed on the brakes into the last corner - Verstappen locking all four tyres - as they played chicken with the DRS trigger line.
But Verstappen came back at him. At the end of lap 45, Leclerc made an error into the last corner and lost a little time.
Then, on the following lap, they were again together into the final corner.
Verstappen rounded it on Leclerc's tail, an oversteer snap slowed the Ferrari's exit, and the DRS overtaking aid did the rest, Verstappen moving past down the straight with the final pass of the race.

Behind the big two
Perez was unlucky to lose out with the safety car.
The rest of the race suggested he did not have the underlying pace to hold Leclerc, and Red Bull would surely have ordered him to let Verstappen by had the Dutchman been behind him.
But he also lost out to Sainz by the closest of margins.
As Sainz exited the pits, he was marginally ahead of Perez at the safety car line on the track. Perez moved ahead on the exit of the corner, but this was against the rules, and Perez had to cede position on the restart.
After that, it was a lonely race for the second drivers of the top teams, and also for George Russell in the Mercedes, comfortably clear of the midfielders but unable to challenger the leaders.
Hamilton at one point looked as if he might finish sixth or seventh, had things gone his way.
The caution period he was awaiting with his long first stint did happen. The team called Hamilton in, but seeing Alonso's car moving slowly and double waved yellow flags, he did not know whether he could overtake.
He slowed and lost nearly six seconds and also decided not to pit, which meant he had to wait another two laps until the virtual safety car ended to pit.
The dropped him to 12th, but he passed a couple of cars in the final stages of the race to take the final point, behind Alpha Tauri's Pierre Gasly and Haas' Kevin Magnussen.
Alonso and Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas were also on for decent points hauls before their mid-race retirements.

Sports,"Saudi Arabian Grand Prix: 'Focus turns to Sunday's race, but big questions remain'
The Saudi Arabian Grand Prix is live on BBC Radio 5 Live and the BBC Sport website
The bosses of Formula 1 and the local authorities managed to talk the drivers into racing at this weekend's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, but there is a lot more work to do to convince some people in the sport that the race should be on the calendar at all.
It took four hours of meetings on Friday evening for the drivers to be persuaded they should race this weekend, after a missile attack on an oil facility nine miles from the circuit lit up the night sky on the Jeddah corniche and initially convinced many of the sport's stars that the grand prix should be called off.
As the drivers sat in a glass-walled room in the paddock, and Friday turned into Saturday, various senior figures came and went from the meeting - the team principals, F1 chairman Stefano Domenicali, FIA president Mohammed Ben Sulayem, ministers in the Saudi government.
And eventually, the drivers agreed to go ahead.
But 24 hours later, the top three men after qualifying did not exactly sound as if they had been turned into ambassadors for the race.
Should Saudi Arabia have a future in F1, Red Bull's surprise pole winner Sergio Perez and the Ferrari drivers Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz were asked?
""There are some considerations we all have to make as a group and see what's best for the sport going forwards,"" Perez said.
""It is definitely a discussion we should have after this race once everything calms down,"" Leclerc added.

'A tricky moment, to say the least'
Committing to a race in Saudi Arabia was always going to be controversial, given the country's human rights record. And F1 has sought to get in front of the accusation that it was complicit in allowing the regime to ""sports-wash"" its global reputation by saying it had secured guarantees from the government in its contract and that it hoped to be a driver for change.
But Lewis Hamilton put the issue front and centre before last year's inaugural race when he admitted he wouldn't say he was comfortable being there, and did so again on Thursday when he said he had not changed his mind, and questioned why progress was not faster.
Other drivers are known to have similar concerns, but chose to keep them in the background, or - lacking Hamilton's profile and impact - were simply not asked how they felt.
Why is Saudi Arabia's involvement in sport controversial?
But with an oil depot in flames, and plumes of black smoke visible from the track, the issue could not be avoided.
The strike was claimed by Yemeni Houthis, with whom Saudi Arabia has been fighting a war for a number of years. And the parallels with F1's decision to cancel the contract of the Russian Grand Prix after the invasion of Ukraine were clear.
Even F1 boss Stefano Domenicali admitted it. ""When I saw that smoke just over there, it reminds [you] of a lot of things we see on TV,"" he said. ""It is pretty clear that was the connection.""
No-one has explicitly admitted it on the record, but it seems that shortly after the end of second practice on Friday, the drivers were set in their decision to pull out.
Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff said: ""The drivers were pretty united in their initial discussions but, when they heard from us and the officials, we were able to convince them that the race was the best thing to do.""
In the day following the meeting, the big question was what the drivers had been told that made them change their minds.
All Saturday, bosses talked of ""reassurances"", that their safety had been guaranteed by the Saudi government.
""Rationality over everything,"" Domenicali said. ""It has been an intense day, sharing with openness, which is the right thing to do for the modern F1.
""There has been a lot of debate, but security is at the maximum level of attention for all of us. And when you talk to the right authorities, the minster of defence and of internal security, when we received assurances everything was under control, we need to rely on that. We inform the teams and drivers and we need to move on.""
Schumacher hit the wall at high speed during qualfiying
'We were considering all scenarios'
Domenicali's words were echoed by team bosses up and down the pit lane, all preaching from the same party line. That the attacks were relatively commonplace in Saudi Arabia - there was one in Jeddah last week while F1 was racing in Bahrain - and always targeted against infrastructure and not civilians or events.
But that argument raised questions. How is it possible to guarantee security against a missile strike? If a missile can hit an oil depot, surely another could hit a race track close by?
Sainz conceded the drivers had been asking themselves the same things.
""We were considering all possible scenarios,"" he said. ""But in the end we all came together. It is 20 of us, with 20 opinions and 20 considerations, 20 different people talking, so it is always going to take a long time.
""In the end, we concluded probably the best thing is to listen to the authorities here and trust them and there is not much more we can do.""
Leclerc said: ""It was more a matter of coming together as drivers to share our opinions and feelings at that moment because it was a tricky moment to say the least.""
""We were concerned about our safety but also the safety of mechanics, engineers, everyone,"" Perez said. ""This is a sport and we are all in it together.""
None of the drivers were prepared to share details of the meeting's content. It went through several phases - with and without team bosses, and with and without F1 bosses and government officials and so on.
Wolff said that the government ""made it clear to us that the worst-case scenario was not cancelling the race but was that there would be a situation where we were unsafe and at risk"".
The meeting did not just address whether it was safe to race, and the right thing to do, but also the potential consequences of any decision not to, many of which were not known, but could be imagined.
F1 and the FIA insist that at no stage was there any suggestion from the race organisers or the government that there could be any negative consequences for F1 personnel from a decision to cancel the race - delays to freight or staff leaving the country, for example.
But that is not the same as that possibility never entering discussions between some of the parties at some stage, which BBC Sport has been told it did.
Hamilton has been uncomfortable inside and outside of the car
'These things happen here'
Saudi Arabia pays one of the largest race fees on the calendar - a reputed $70m (£53m) a year - and has one of the longest contracts. The country also pays for advertising at tracks for its national oil company, which is one of the sport's biggest sponsorship partners, and is working with F1 on the fully sustainable fuels the sport plans to introduce in 2026 as part of its plan to go carbon neutral by 2030.
But the link with Saudi Arabia was always going to carry risks. The reputational ones were already understood, and F1 always had an argument for that.
""Does Saudi Arabia and some of the other Middle Eastern countries share the same values, the same culture as we do in Europe?"" Wolff said. ""They don't.
""Are they where we want them to be? No. Can we put the spotlight into this place by racing here in F1 and making those things visible and making it a better place? I still think so.
""I would rather come here and make the spotlight shine on the region so it needs to be in a better place rather than say: 'I am not going there; I don't want to hear anything of it.'""
But a missile attack in full view of the race track on the actual race weekend is something else. That seems not have been factored in. And if it was, no-one told the drivers.
""I love going to Tel Aviv,"" Wolff said, ""but if you are in Tel Aviv you are pretty used to situations where drones are being flown over. It goes both directions.
""There wasn't any attack into Saudi Arabia that caused any civilian casualties, as far as I have been told, for a long time, so that's why we just need to understand that it is culturally very different to how we see our western cultures.
""For us, is it acceptable if 10 miles away there is a drone rocket that is going into a petrol tank? Certainly not. But these things happen here.""
By Saturday evening, people in F1 were trying to move the conversation on, but even then there was an admission that the issue was not going away.
""I think it's time to focus on the race,"" Sainz said. ""There will be plenty to discuss in the future.""
There were lots of other topics on Saturday evening after qualifying, prime among them fresh concerns about the safety of the track following the massive accident that has ruled Haas driver Mick Schumacher out of the race, and Hamilton's worst competitive performance for 13 years.
Hamilton gave succinct answers on that topic, which he blamed on a wrong set-up direction that gave him a lack of rear grip in a Mercedes car that is already struggling for competitiveness. He was also asked about the over-arching issue of the weekend.
""I am looking forward to getting out,"" he said."
Sports,"Formula 1: One year since Murray Walker died
An energetic, enthusiastic, sometimes 'muddly' talker
It's just over a year since legendary commentator Murray Walker passed away, aged 97.
He first broadcast on the airwaves way back in 1949, at the British Grand Prix, and became a full-time F1 commentator in 1978, retiring in 2001.
Throughout those years, he became the voice of the sport.
""Murray garnered the respect normally reserved for drivers,"" says Maurice Hamilton, who has written a biography about the man.
""Throughout the sixties, the only channel you could get motorsport coverage on was the BBC, so Murray was motorsport.""
Hamilton has been covering motorsport as a journalist since 1977 and has written multiple books about F1 teams and drivers, including Niki Lauda, Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna and James Hunt.
Hamilton also worked for 20 years on BBC Radio 5 Live as a Formula 1 summariser and remembers being lucky enough to work with Walker. He describes it to us as like, ""going to work with your favourite uncle"".
Hamilton's book is packed with some of Walker's most famous and delightful on-air blunders, or 'Murrayisms'.
Here are some takeaways...
The voice of F1
The book opens with one of Walker's most famous pieces of commentary, from the final laps of the 1986 Australian Grand Prix.
""Rosberg out! Keke Rosberg! Out of the Australian Grand Prix! If this isn't a sensation, I'd like to know what is.""
""And look at that! Colossally, that's Mansell! That is Nigel Mansell. The car absolutely shatters. He's fighting for control. You can see what's happened. Now - this could change, and will change, the World Championship.""
""Either that car is stationary, or it's on the move.""
Hamilton calls this piece of commentary, ""Murray in extremis.""
""The line, 'colossally' - who even says that?""
The book is peppered with commentary from plenty of other memorable races too: the 1976 Japanese grand prix, where James Hunt sealed the championship; Suzuka '89, which determined that year's World Championship in Alain Prost's favour after he and his bitter rival Ayrton Senna both went off track; Imola '94, in which Senna was killed in an accident; Adelaide '94, where a controversial collision between Michael Schumacher and Damon Hill edged the title in favour of the former…
""I thought to myself, 'what is the essence of Murray Walker?',"" Hamilton explains, adding, ""It's the commentary. I realised that we weren't going to have his voice in the book, but that I could get as near as possible by putting commentary in.""
""Damon Hill is leading. Behind him are the second and third men.""
His universal appeal
One story within the book - an anecdote shared by former FIA president Max Mosley - illustrates the kind of wide appeal that Walker had.
Mosley describes being at the 1993 grand prix in South Africa, where there were lots of dignitaries from the government and the ANC (African National congress) present - one of whom was the now-current president of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa. Mosley asked Ramaphosa whether there was anyone he might like to meet, expecting him to suggest someone like Ayrton Senna.
""And Mansell is slowing down. He is definitely taking it easy. Oh no he isn't - that was a lap record""
""He said Murray Walker! We went into the press room together and stood in front of Murray's desk, where he was writing. I introduced Ramaphosa to him. Murray seemed as surprised as I was but, of course, he was absolutely charming and Mr Ramaphosa was delighted!""
A difficult relationship
One man whom Walker didn't rub along with quite so well, at least initially, was James Hunt.
Hunt was a former Formula 1 Champion and went on to form a very successful commentary partnership with Walker on the BBC from 1980 until his tragic death in 1993, aged 45.
However, when Hunt was first introduced, Hamilton says that Walker was concerned the BBC were trying to, ""ease him out"".
There are quotes within the book describing how Walker first received his commentary partner.
""My thoughts were: He may be a world champion racing driver, and a very good world champion racing driver, but what on Earth does he know about commentating? And, what's more, I didn't particularly like him as a person. I was old enough to be his father. My views on life were diametrically opposed to his. I was a pretty plonking straightforward up-and-down bloke and here I was with this booze-swilling, cigarette-smoking, womanizing, drug-taking chap who I associated with rudeness and being objectionable.""
Murray the 'muddly talker'
""Do my eyes deceive me, or is Senna's car sounding a bit rough?""
For someone so studious and knowledgeable, Walker had an incredible knack for making some very entertaining mistakes during his commentary.
""The Murrayisms are such an integral part of him,"" Hamilton observes. ""We waited for them and loved it when they happened.""
For Hamilton, this was just symptomatic of a mind too full of information. He remembers seeing Walker's commentary box, ""festooned with notes"".
""During the race, something would occur that would trigger a thought and he had to get that out to you. In his enthusiasm to do that, he would sometimes trip over his words and make mistakes."""
Sports,"Bahrain Grand Prix: Ferrari are finally back - can Charles Leclerc mount title challenge?
The Saudi Arabian GP is live on 5 Live and the BBC Sport website
If the battle between Charles Leclerc and Max Verstappen is any measure of the season to come in Formula 1, it is going to be quite a year.
Mercedes' struggles with their car after the huge change of regulations for 2022 have taken Lewis Hamilton out of the title battle - for now, at least, and possibly for the year if his team cannot find some rather large solutions quickly.
But Leclerc and Verstappen staged a gripping contest in the Bahrain Grand Prix. They raced wheel to wheel for two laps, swapping the lead five times, before the Ferrari driver came out on top.
If their battle was the highlight of the race, it was not the most dramatic moment. That was saved for the final three laps, when both Red Bulls retired with the same problem - something to do with the fuel system, the team said - and lost second and fourth places.
Leclerc's consummate victory - a drive that had pace, control, maturity, coolness and aggression - has put him in a strong position but it means little at the start of F1's longest ever season other than one very important point: Ferrari are back with a bang.

It was clean getaway for every car at the start
A renaissance at Maranello
It has been a long road back to this point for F1's most famous team. They were last absolutely competitive in 2017 and 2018, but let those titles slip through their fingers with a series of mistakes from the team and their then lead driver Sebastian Vettel.
The following year had its highlights - Leclerc scored more pole positions than anyone and won two races - but it was clouded by a controversy over their engine.
They lost performance over the final races after a rule clarification over usage of the hybrid system, and over the following winter it was revealed that they had come to a private settlement with governing body the FIA, which said it had doubts the engine had always been run legally.
In 2020, their engine took a huge step backwards in power. They made progress in 2021. But their lack of competitiveness in those seasons ensured they always saw 2022's rules reset as a chance to bounce back to the front. On the evidence of Bahrain, the work and focus has paid off.
The Ferrari - at least in Leclerc's hands - was the quickest car in Bahrain. But only just. He beat Verstappen to pole by just over 0.1 seconds and had a small but ultimately decisive advantage in the race.
Leclerc was able to answer everything Verstappen threw at him. He edged away in the first stint. He was able to fight back past the Red Bull twice after Verstappen closed up with an earlier first pit stop - helped by an error by Leclerc on his in-lap and a sticky wheel change - and once back in front was always in control.
Ferrari gave themselves more margin for the second stops - a larger lead before them, and a better in-lap from Leclerc were followed by a faster stop. A safety car threatened to undo all the good work, but Leclerc handled the restart consummately.
""We were sure we would be in a better position but we didn't know where,"" he said. ""And now we see we are in the mix to fight for the title, it's amazing. We are both very happy to have a car capable of winning. And we will fight for it for sure.""
It's been clear for a long time that Leclerc is a potential world champion if only he could get his hands on the right car. The guy is so fast, and he races hard. This was a brilliant drive, and he was miles clear of team-mate Carlos Sainz for most of the weekend, the Spaniard admitting he needed to work hard to understand where his deficits were coming from.
F1 releases new overtaking guidelines
Charles Leclerc wins as both Red Bulls retire
A brutal day for Red Bull
Red Bull had been favourites coming into the race
Red Bull had been favourites coming into the race, but in the end Verstappen could not deliver on that status.
Some questioned Verstappen's tactical approach to their battle after the first pit stops. Why keep trying into Turn One, some wondered, when he knew Leclerc would have the DRS overtaking aid to get him back into Turn Four? Wouldn't it have been better to try into Turn Four?
But ultimately it made no difference. For one, Verstappen had cooked his brakes in the fight and needed to ""let Charles go"" to cool them down. For another, a track rod was bent after his second pit stop, which gave him uneven steering. And then there was the mysterious problem that ended the races of both him and team-mate Sergio Perez.
Verstappen said: ""It looked like there was no fuel coming to the engine and everything just turned off so I just rolled into the pit lane.""
Team boss Christian Horner blamed ""an issue within the fuel system"" but was not immediately more specific than that.
Rivals, though, believed the team had messed up. They had not done a single race distance in six days of pre-season testing, it was said. Was this a consequence of a lack of preparation?
Horner said they ""know the fuel was in there"". But it sounds like the system was not getting it to the engine. And 30 points have now gone begging.
In all of this, Verstappen was not a happy man, even before the breakdown.
He did not like the car balance. He complained about the strategy, said he regretted following instructions and not pushing hard on his out laps from the pits, believing he could have passed Leclerc if he had. Horner pointed out if you took more out of the tyres early in the stint, you pay at the end.
""We just didn't quite have their pace today,"" Horner said.
There were those who suggested that Red Bull's problems were karma after the events of Abu Dhabi last year. Hamilton would not rise to that one: ""I don't have a response. I am just focused on our job.""
And Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff also shrugged it off: ""The importance of the race in Abu Dhabi was greater than the importance of this race here as the opening of the 2022 season. I don't wish anybody that. It was certainly a brutal race for them.""
Mercedes up against it
Lewis Hamilton claimed third after Red Bull's Sergio Perez retired
Red Bull at least know they have a quick car. The same cannot be said of Mercedes. At least not yet.
Hamilton benefited from the misfortunes of Verstappen and Perez and took a podium position very few would have predicted before the race.
But the realities of Mercedes' plight are clear. The car is something like 0.8 seconds a lap off the pace or possibly a little more in the race. The team believe it has potential but that is a lot of potential to unlock.
Mercedes' pace is defined by the ride-height at which they have to run their car to stop it suffering from ""porpoising"" or high-frequency bouncing on the straights.
The new rules make it advantageous to run the cars low but this can trigger the problem. Raising the ride-height is the way to fix it but this makes the car slower.
But all the cars are prone to porpoising if run too low. It is just that the Mercedes is slower than the Ferrari and Red Bull when in the set-up needed to reduce it.
Right now, the team do not have answers to their problems. Is it that they will be able to be competitive if they can find the floor modifications needed to change the airflow to bleed off downforce above a certain speed to stop the porpoising as it happens, as Ferrari and Red Bull are believed to be doing?
Or is it that the car is just not very good at the moment and simply does not have enough downforce?
There are further questions about the Mercedes engine, after all their cars were towards the bottom of the speed trap times. But Mercedes believe it is not so much that they have lost performance, more that Ferrari and Honda have gained it over the winter and that there is now nothing to choose between the three engines, whereas last year Mercedes had an advantage.
""We need to analyse the drag levels first before we really make a judgment of whether we are lacking power,"" team boss Toto Wolff said. ""I don't think there are big differences in the power unit but clearly Ferrari made a big step forward because last year they weren't totally competitive and it looks at this single event as if they've out-performed everyone else.""
""It is going to be such a hard battle,"" Hamilton said. ""But we love a challenge, I really do enjoy a challenge.""
It's a good job. Because this one looks as big as any he has had for a long time.
But it is less than those facing Mercedes customers McLaren and Aston Martin. They had awful weekends and were among the slowest cars out there. It was something of a shock to both and there will be a lot of furrowed brows as they try to work out what has gone wrong.
Have the rules worked?
The new rules were introduced to bring the field closer together and to make racing and overtaking easier. Have they worked? It's too hard to say right now.
There is still a sizable gap between the two fastest teams and the rest of the field.
The drivers agreed that it was perhaps a little easier to follow more closely behind another car. Perhaps this was a factor in allowing Leclerc and Verstappen to battle for two whole laps in the way they did.
Hamilton was also able to stick with Perez for a surprisingly long time early in the race. But he dropped back - and he did so partly because his car lacked the inherent pace, but also because he had rooted his tyres.
And this is the biggest concern. Privately, some drivers were damning about the new Pirellis. F1's tyre supplier was supposed to be designing tyres that were more robust and allowed drivers to run closer to the limit in races for longer and race harder with other cars.
But the margin between qualifying lap times and those in the race was little different to last year and degradation remained high.
It is far too early to make any definitive conclusions about either the car changes or the tyres. Perhaps things will look different in future races. But for now it does not appear as if racing has been revolutionised by the new rules."
Sports,"Drive to Survive: Producers say Formula 1 is 'not run for Netflix'
Drive to Survive producers deny there has been any 'Netflix effect' on Formula 1
The new Formula 1 season is only a week away - but can it match the drama and controversy of 2021 and that final race, in which Max Verstappen snatched the title from Lewis Hamilton?
The fallout has barely subsided during the three-month off-season, with the removal of race director Michael Masi, question marks over seven-time champion Hamilton's future, and an ongoing rivalry between Red Bull team principal Christian Horner and Mercedes counterpart Toto Wolff.
And now the fourth series of Drive to Survive - the hit all-access Netflix documentary about F1 - is streaming, taking us behind the scenes of last year's epic championship battle, which was decided on the final day of the season by a controversial call and a one-lap shootout.
Among the many accusations in the aftermath of that thrilling Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was the claim it had been engineered for maximum entertainment - sacrificing sporting integrity for TV drama.
But, speaking to BBC Sport, the producers of Drive to Survive said there was simply no way decisions were made with Netflix in mind.
James Gay-Rees said the suggestion was ""a total red herring"", adding: ""It's just people under enormous pressure making decisions in the moment. There's no way anybody was thinking: 'Will this play well on Netflix?'""
Despite that, some within F1 have suggested the show creates, or at least exaggerates, narratives.
Wolff was quoted this week as saying: ""They create a spin to the narrative. They put scenes together that didn't happen. I guess you'd say as an insider: 'Well, that's different than how it was.'
""But we're creating entertainment, and that is a new dimension of entertainment.""
Paul Martin - one of the show's creators - takes a different view, telling BBC Sport: ""Over the four series, Drive to Survive hasn't over-editorialised anything.""
Verstappen is another from within the sport to have voiced some criticism for the documentary - and he doesn't give original interviews to its makers.
He said of the series: ""They faked a few rivalries which don't really exist.""
Gay-Rees responded: ""It's a headline that everybody's jumped on, but I think it's a very subtle thing. Nobody could point to any misrepresentations or inaccuracies in the series.""
Here are three things we learned from watching the series...
The final three races of the season are as dramatic as we remember
The series finale looks at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix
The final two episodes of the series cover the season's final three races - in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi.
If you are hoping for unseen insights on the conversations between the main players - Hamilton, Verstappen, Wolff, Horner and Masi - you may be disappointed.
Gay-Rees explains: ""It was all broadcast at the time - it's just a question of how we use it. The aftermath doesn't figure in the series - that's above and beyond our remit.""
And Martin says the show doesn't take a view on how the season concluded, adding: ""We're not there to form opinion. We're there to tell an authentic version of what went down and how that race ended.""
Nevertheless, it's compelling to watch those final races again.
In an interview with 5 Live Breakfast, Gay-Rees said of the final episode: ""I don't think I've seen a sports documentary like this which just grabs you by the throat and doesn't let you breathe for 45 minutes.""
In that episode we cut between the drivers and the team principals going wild throughout the race. And it is clear when Wolff is interviewed afterwards that he doesn't accept the way things turned out.
""Max was worthy of winning the championship, but not in the way it happened,"" he tells the film-makers, adding: ""If you're doing a good enough job, you will win the race. But here, that is not how it went. The decision was simply wrong.""
He also strikes a combative tone when he says Red Bull ""couldn't have done any more to motivate"" his team for the coming season, adding: ""Everyone has a target on their backs.""
Horner v Wolff is a rivalry that keeps on giving
Red Bull's Christian Horner is out to get Toto Wolff's Mercedes team
There is no sign of hostilities between Horner and Wolff easing up, with the former telling BBC Sport earlier this week that he believed Mercedes' ""bullying"" had led to Masi's removal as race director.
It's a narrative that plays out throughout the TV series, and ramps up in the final two episodes.
Gay-Rees told 5 Live Breakfast: ""I think people assume they ham it up for the cameras, and I don't think that's true.""
At one point in the series, Horner even jokes about whether he could beat Wolff in a fight.
""Christian is a little bit like a Jack Russell terrier, who likes to snap at your heels,"" says Wolff.
Horner says Wolff ""maybe feels that I antagonise him a bit,"" but adds: ""That's part of the sport.""
Wolff knows that Horner is waiting for him to slip up
Life at Haas is not plain sailing
Haas sacked driver Nikita Mazepin last week after Russia's invasion of Ukraine as Mazepin's father Dmitry, who was a team sponsor, has close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
But, as the series depicts, it was never an easy relationship.
Mazepin Jr had a torrid time during his first season in Formula 1 - never finishing higher than 14th.
He seems to blame everyone but himself, and in one scene we see team principal Guenther Steiner having to advise the young driver not to be so aggressive to his engineering team.
After one outburst by Mazepin, Steiner says: ""That's why people hate you.""
What's more, Mazepin's father is shown to be interfering.
In one scene in episode four, he asks Steiner what he's doing with his son and warns him: ""If it doesn't change, I will send an official letter that we will stop financing."""
Sports,"Formula 1: Russian driver Nikita Mazepin and father Dmitry sanctioned by EU
Mazepin and team-mate Mick Schumacher failed to register a point in the entire 2021 season
Ex-Haas driver Nikita Mazepin and his father Dmitry have been added to a list of Russians sanctioned over the invasion of Ukraine.
On Wednesday the European Union declared chemicals billionaire Dmitry Mazepin ""a member of the closest circle of [President] Vladimir Putin"".
An EU document accused Mazepin Sr of ""supporting or implementing actions which undermine or threaten"" Ukraine.
His business was providing ""substantial revenue"" to the Russian government.
Nikita Mazepin said on Wednesday that he did not believe his sacking by the US-based team at the weekend was ""fair"", adding that he ""didn't deserve it"".
Denmark's Magnussen replaces Mazepin at Haas
But the EU said he was ""a natural person associated with a leading businessperson [his father] involved in economic sectors providing a substantial source of revenue to the government of the Russian Federation, which is responsible for the annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation of Ukraine"".
Mazepin owed his seat to sponsorship funding from the Russian chemicals business Uralkali, which is part-owned by his father through his company Uralchem.
The EU is attempting to close loopholes in its sanctions against allies of Putin.
Those named on the list will be subject to an assets freeze and visa-ban blacklist.
Mazepin Sr's presence at a meeting with Putin at the Kremlin on 24 February was cited as a specific example of his links to the war.
The EU statement said Mazepin, along with 36 other businesspeople, ""met with President Vladimir Putin and other members of the Russian government to discuss the impact of the course of action in the wake of Western sanctions"".
It added: ""The fact that he was invited to attend this meeting shows that he is a member of the closest circle of Vladimir Putin and that he is supporting or implementing actions or policies which undermine or threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine, as well as stability and security in Ukraine.""
The move means Nikita Mazepin would not have been able to take part in a significant number of races for Haas this year, even if the team had not terminated his contract.
Nikita Mazepin claimed at a news conference on Wednesday that there was ""no legal reason that could enable the team to terminate my contract"".
He said he had committed to race as a neutral, as permitted by F1's governing body the FIA, but refused to say whether he approved or disapproved of Putin's decision to invade Ukraine.
He also did not answer questions about whether he would have signed a document the FIA requires of all Russian and Belarussian drivers that commits them to comply with decisions made by the FIA on 1 March, when the organisation announced it ""condemned"" the invasion.
Mazepin said the question was irrelevant because he did not have a contract to race.
Asked whether it was possible for him to be perceived as a neutral athlete in the context of his father's links to the Kremlin, Mazepin reiterated that the FIA had ""ruled that drivers can compete if they are neutral. This I am ready to agree with. And I was ready to consider myself neutral to compete"".
He added: ""Formula 1 is not a closed chapter for me. I will be ready to race in case there is an opportunity to return. I wish all the best to the drivers who will replace me. They have nothing to do with the existing situation."""
Sports,"Formula 1 testing: Red Bull unhappy with Mercedes upgrade in Bahrain
Hamilton and Verstappen met again in Bahrain for second testing
Mercedes are at the centre of a row over the legality of their car after introducing a radical new design at the second pre-season test.
Formula 1 managing director Ross Brawn said the car's aerodynamics around its sidepods was a ""very extreme interpretation of the regulations"".
Red Bull team boss Christian Horner told Germany's Auto Motor Und Sport: ""Mercedes have gone a step too far.
""That does not correspond to the spirit of the regulations,"" he said.
""For us, these wings are illegal.""
Red Bull initially described the quotes attributed to Horner as ""incorrect"", before clarifying they were not ""official"".
Horner later told Sky Sports: ""I was slightly surprised to be reading comments that I was supposed to have been making.
Testing schedule
""I haven't paid a great deal of attention to [the Mercedes car]. It is obviously a fairly different concept, but that is for the aero guys and the designers to get into.""
The revised Mercedes has been dubbed the ""no sidepod car"" because of the extreme way the world champions have managed to shrink the bodywork beside the driver around the car's cooling requirements.
Horner also seems to have taken issue with the integration of a shaped side-impact structure on which the rear-view mirrors are mounted.
He said: ""Those are not mirror mounts, but two wings. In addition, they have built vertical baffles on top. They have nothing to do with the mirror mount.""
Ferrari team principal Mattia Binotto also raised questions about the Mercedes design.
""No doubt it is a great car - that should not be a surprise to us,"" he said. ""A concept quite different to ours, quite interesting with the cooling layout, and the sidepods.
""On the mirrors, it was surprising - we were not expecting that. We always said the mirror should have no aero[dynamic] purpose and the way they treated their cars there is a significant aero purpose in the mirrors.
""The risk in the future is that all teams will start designing mirrors that look like spaceships. In the spirit of what we intend to do for the future, it is something we need to discuss.""
Mercedes F1 team principal Toto Wolff said he was not concerned about any problems developing with the rules.
Wolff said governing body the FIA had been involved throughout the design process.
""It's clear that sometimes when you come with an innovation it creates the kind of debate we're having here,"" Wolff added. ""It was expected.
""We were keen in not running alone with that, but being in touch with the FIA. That's why I think it will be OK.""
Brawn emphasised that, under F1's new governance procedure this year, rules can be changed mid-season if eight of the 10 teams agree.
""Once the interpretation Mercedes has made has been understood, then we can get a balanced view on what impact it's going to have,"" he said.
""The 'spirit' [of the rules] is such a grey area. At the end of the day, you have to go on the wording of the regulations, but that wording can be changed with an 80% team majority.
""If something has slipped by [in the rule-writing process], then the teams are aware that can happen. So that could happen live during the season. We'll have to see how this one plays out.""
The Mercedes car featured different sidepod designs
Brawn said his primary concern was whether teams' designs undermine the intent of the rules to make racing better by allowing cars to follow each other more closely than in the past.
Out on the track, Alpha Tauri's Pierre Gasly set the fastest time of the day, ahead of the Ferraris of Charles Leclerc and Carlos Sainz and Lance Stroll's Aston Martin.
Headline lap times in testing are unreliable indicators of actual competitiveness because of the myriad ways teams can alter their cars' specification to affect lap time.
Mercedes drivers George Russell and Lewis Hamilton were ninth and 11th fastest after Russell drove in the afternoon session and the seven-time champion went out in the morning.
Russell said of the car's new features: ""It looks interesting but it's not about how it looks it's about how fast it goes. It caught quite a few people's eyes this morning.
""I am proud to be part of a team that is pushing innovation and seeing something pretty spectacular being pulled off is pretty incredible.""
The session was stopped eight minutes early when Red Bull's Sergio Perez had a spin and then inadvertently reversed into the gravel and became stuck when trying to get going again.

Sports,"Formula 1 2022: Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen return to the track
The Bahrain GP is on BBC Radio 5 Live and the BBC Sport website
Three months on from the tumultuous climax to the 2021 championship, a new one begins with the shadows of that day in Abu Dhabi still hanging over the sport.
After losing an eighth world drivers' title in controversial and painful circumstances, Lewis Hamilton and his Mercedes team are trying to move on, at least in public.
The man who beat him, Max Verstappen, probably starts the new season as favourite, but his Red Bull team principal Christian Horner continues to snipe, throwing various accusations at Mercedes. That they ""bullied"" the sport's governing body into making changes; they mounted a campaign to discredit Verstappen's title, and so on.
Meanwhile, the ramifications of a day on which the sport's referee made up the rules as he went along continue to reverberate. The FIA, recognising that errors were made at Yas Marina, has indeed made changes.
A report into the events of the day is expected to be published this weekend. But already race director Michael Masi has been moved into a different role, his freestyling with the rules under extreme pressure at Yas Marina judged to have made his position untenable.
In his place, two people will alternate in a role that is not meant to be so high profile. A more robust structure has been put in place around them. And a face from the past has been brought back to try to add a little gravitas and experience.
'If the times are hard to read, look for the smirk'
How to follow the Bahrain GP on the BBC
The new race directors will be advised by Herbie Blash, F1 veteran and long-time associate of the late FIA F1 director Charlie Whiting, whose death on the eve of the 2019 season saw Masi elevated into the role he has now lost.
As if that was not enough to be going along with, the sport's rule book has been ripped up and rewritten from scratch. An all-new set of technical regulations has been introduced in the hope of producing cars that are closer in terms of performance, and can race more effectively, too.
The cars' front and rear wings have changed to smooth airflow
The cars
The cars that will be seen on track over the 22 or 23 races between now and mid-November are the product of four years of research by F1 and the FIA, and two years of development work by the teams.
After extensive analysis by a team under F1 managing director Ross Brawn, the cars' aerodynamics have been fundamentally revised, in an attempt to ensure drivers can follow each other more closely. And the rules have been made deliberately prescriptive to try to reduce the performance gap between the front and back of the field.
The fear was that this would create a field of lookalikes. But in fact there is more visual variation between the 10 cars than for some considerable time, much to the relief of both the teams themselves, and the sport's aficionados.
The three teams expected to lead the way at the start of the season - Red Bull, Ferrari and Mercedes - have all taken strikingly different approaches to solving the same set of problems.
Mercedes have shrunk their car's bodywork to such an extreme extent that its sidepods are almost not there. Red Bull have created dramatic cutaways underneath theirs. And Ferrari's are almost bulbous, but with elegant scallop-type curves cut out of the top of them. Even the cars' noses are different - Ferrari's narrow and needle-like against the more conventional, squarer ones of Mercedes and Red Bull.
Hamilton was relaxed and happy during a public appearance on Monday
Who seems to be fastest?
The three big teams ended pre-season testing fastest, with lap times within a few tenths of a second of each other. But Red Bull looked strongest, and not just because Verstappen set the quickest time.
Ferrari showed the most consistent performance, while Mercedes looked on the back foot. McLaren, promising early in testing, hit reliability problems later on that need solving before the car hits the track this weekend.
Hamilton has said he ""doesn't think we'll be competing for wins"" at the start of the season. Verstappen is treating that claim with scepticism. He harked back to previous years in which a difficult pre-season for Mercedes was followed by a victory at the first race, when he said of the world champion's attempts to play down expectations: ""It's always like this.""
Out on track, though, the Mercedes did appear to be in trouble. It was clearly a handful for its drivers, Hamilton and highly rated new recruit George Russell. And Alpha Tauri's Pierre Gasly, who spent a couple of laps following Hamilton on the final day of testing, backed up his claims.
""I could see Lewis was struggling and I think they do have some work to do to be fighting right at the top,"" the Frenchman said. ""But it's only testing.""
Bouncing cars and 'porpoising'
The Mercedes was suffering badly with a phenomenon that has not been seen in F1 for 40 years - 'porpoising'.
This is a kind of high-frequency bouncing caused by an aerodynamic disruption to which these cars are vulnerable following the rule changes.
It's a word from the past - it was commonplace back in the late 1970s and '80s, when the 'ground-effect' aerodynamics that have been reintroduced with these cars were last permitted. But almost no-one in an engineering position in F1 now was around back then, and its occurrence caught all the teams by surprise.
One man who was around in the early 1980s was Adrian Newey, Red Bull's chief technical officer, who was just starting his career as the last ground-effect era came to an end.
Can it be a coincidence that Red Bull seem most on top of the phenomenon? They seemed not to experience it at all once their final upgrade was introduced on the last day of testing.
For all Verstappen's scepticism, the GPS speed traces to which all teams have access backed up Mercedes' claims. Their main time loss was in the corners - which belies the suggestion from Ferrari that their apparent lack of pace was caused by them using their engine in a lower power mode.
The Ferrari was especially good in slow corners, struggling in the quicker stuff, and not so great on the straights. The Red Bull seemed to be strong everywhere.
Hence Verstappen's status as favourite. The Dutchman is a phenomenon, a force of nature. His 2021 season was outstanding, even if his uber-aggressive racing tactics are not to everyone's liking, and he's a talent worthy of the title of world champion regardless of one's views of what transpired in Abu Dhabi.
If the Red Bull is as good as it looks, Verstappen will take some stopping. But it should be borne in mind that, after such a huge regulation change, development rates will be high, and the destiny of the championship will likely depend on who can add the most pace to their car over the season, while staying within the budget cap, lowered this year by $5m to $140m.
Bahrain kicks off what is expected to be a 23-race season
Will the racing be closer?
It's an old cliche in F1, but no less true for that, that a true picture of the shape of the season will only begin to be formed after a few races.
Brawn is confident the changes he has overseen will work. Regardless, for now, the impression that the field spread does seem to be reduced, and some positive signs about the cars' raceability need to be treated with caution.
A number of drivers said during testing that it did appear to be easier to follow more closely, in that the amount of grip they lost seemed to be reduced.
But some added that the 'tow' effect - a speed gain created when close behind a car because of the hole in the air it creates - had been reduced, and said the one might cancel out the other.
Then there is the question of the tyres. Since Pirelli came into F1 as sole supplier in 2011, the tyres have been prone to overheating. This has meant drivers have had to drive within themselves much of the time to keep the rubber within the required temperature threshold.
This had two related effects - drivers were usually well under the cars' limit, and racing was difficult because if a driver pushed to try to overtake, the tyres would quickly overheat.
Among the rule changes this year was the introduction of bigger wheels and lower-profile tyres, and Pirelli was asked to change the tyre design to make them more robust - less sensitive to overheating and more durable, so drivers could push closer to the limit all the time, and race harder. After all, there is not much point creating more 'raceable' cars if the tyres turn into liquorice when you're trying to follow another car.
There are mixed messages as to whether this has been successful. In one news conference this winter, Aston Martin's Lance Stroll said the tyres were no different in their characteristics, only for Ferrari's Carlos Sainz to say he was more optimistic about Pirelli having been successful to some extent.
In Bahrain last week, the sport's two most successful active drivers had their say. Four-time champion Sebastian Vettel pointed out that heavier cars meant ""the challenge to Pirelli has increased"", adding: ""We need to wait and see - see how it feels, see if we can race closer and harder, or whether we start sliding.""
Hamilton, meanwhile, was scathing. ""The tyres are worse this year,"" he said. ""Following behind another car looks a little better, which is hopefully the right direction. I hope we can maybe get some better tyres at some stage, or maybe they work better in places not so hot.""
What else has changed?
F1 did a remarkable job over the past two years to stage two full seasons in the midst of the pandemic. Now the threat of Covid-19 seems to be receding, it has ambitions to host its longest-ever season at 23 races, crammed into a month's less time than the 22 events of 2021.
The season ends in mid-November rather than mid-December so as not to clash with the Fifa World Cup.
One race has already fallen by the wayside, the Russian Grand Prix cancelled for the foreseeable future as a result of the invasion of Ukraine, but F1 aims to replace it. And to hold so many races in such a short time, changes have been made to the weekend structure.
The idea is to cut F1 weekends from four days to three, to lessen the load on the teams. The first casualty is the media day on Thursday - now, the news conferences are on Friday morning before a later start to practice. It's going to mean a very long day for everyone on the Friday before the competition proper starts on Saturday.
Attempts to double the number of 'sprint' events to six foundered on a row over money, so there will be three of those again.
But the big test is the rules. Will this new era really be better and brighter than ever, the competition closer throughout the field?
After the last era ended with one of the greatest seasons in history, it has a lot to live up to.
Bahrain on Sunday will begin to provide the answers as to whether this grand experiment will succeed."

Agnew: He scored successive hundreds and I think you need to keep that separate to his captaincy. The good things are that his captaincy woes haven't affected his batting. He's obviously in credit from a batting perspective.
Dan Lawrence
Innings: Six, Runs: 197, Average: 32.83, High score: 91, Wickets: Two
Agnew: I liked him. He batted with lots of flair, but it is disappointing how he got out in the second innings in Grenada. He'd have credit in the bank for me.
Wilson: He's in credit because the way he played in both Antigua and Barbados was for the team and very selfless. When conditions were in his favour he really took advantage of that and he elevated the game wonderfully in Barbados so I'd give him a big tick for that. He found it a little bit more difficult in Grenada - he struggled to line up his off stump and he made the misjudgement in the second innings so you'd take a little bit back - but overall there is something encouraging.
Ben Stokes
Innings: Six, Runs: 194, Average: 32.33, High score: 120, Wickets: Seven
Agnew: He had a much more demanding tour than England would have perhaps wanted because of the injury to Mark Wood. There is no doubt that he really reasserted himself back on the team having had issues in the last couple of years - they seem to be in the background now. He was very clearly playing a strong vice captaincy role during the tour and it may be that he is the man who steps up to take over the team. He is credit.
Jonny Bairstow
Innings: Six, Runs: 226, Average: 45.20, High score: 140
Agnew: He got a good hundred in Antigua, and he's always enthusiastic. He's in credit.
Ben Foakes
Innings: Six, Runs: 96, Average: 19.20, High score: 42
Agnew: He's in the work to do section for me. He did keep well, but I'm not entirely convinced about him at seven and the run out in the second innings in Grenada was an utter brainstorm.
Wilson: It was a shame for him because he's had a couple of opportunities on this tour - he made 40-odd in Antigua and he couldn't go on and then in the final game in Grenada, Joshua da Silva - the West Indies keeper - really battled and understood the situation of the game, I don't see any reason why Foakes couldn't have played an innings like that. Maybe it is a lot to ask, but I think he's got the ability. He really gave his wicket away.
Chris Woakes
Matches: Three, Wickets: Five, Average: 48.80, Best figures: 3-59, Runs: 140, Average: 35.00
Agnew: I feel a bit harsh putting him in the backwards category. He's had opportunities, and I feel a bit harsh because he bowled on two absolute roads.
Wilson: He's played a lot of cricket since last summer - he is a key player in the T20 side and then played four of the five Ashes Tests before being asked to come and lead the attack away from home, with a ball that does you no favours, on a couple of surfaces that will do you no favours. He makes no excuses - he says this is his chance and there hasn't been a word of mumble or grumble from him and I can only commend him for that. He's a great guy.
Craig Overton
Matches: Three, Wickets: Four, Average: 47.25, Best figures: 2-81
Agnew: He was pressed into bowling that short-pitch length in Grenada because there was simply nobody with much pace playing in the game - normally he wouldn't be asked to do it. He will remain very much in contention during the summer - it is clear that the selectors rate him highly. He just needs to work on a nagging accuracy, rather in the way Angus Fraser used to bowl, so he's got work to do.
Jack Leach
Matches: Three, Wickets: 11, Average: 30.81, Best figures: 6-154
Agnew: Leach is an interesting one. He's in credit for me, even though I know he was disappointed with the way he bowled in Barbados. What I like about Leach is that he acknowledges that and he is working so hard to get better. That's why he's in credit for me.
Wilson: He's had a good tour - he's the leading wicket-taker and he's bowled over after over. He isn't here for his batting but his commitment and the way he dug England out of a hole in Grenada is credit to him. He's in credit.
Saqib Mahmood
Matches: Two, Wickets: Six, Average: 22.83, Best figures: 4-79
Agnew: He was one of the finds of the tour for me. He's in credit.
Wilson: From the moment his name was put in the squad I was looking forward to him playing. He might not have done if Mark Wood hadn't got injured and Ollie Robinson was fit, but he has absolutely grabbed his chance as best as he could. He's shown not only real potential but also real skill. The West Indies found him the most threatening bowler in Barbados. He's a big tick for me - he's got credit in the bank, and I really look forward to seeing him in the summer.
Matthew Fisher
Matches: One, Wickets: One, Average: 71, Best figures: 1-67
Agnew: He made a really promising debut on a desperately flat and slow wicket in Barbados. He has a really nice high action - he's clearly very highly rated by the coaches. I'd like to see him bowl in England because, comparatively, he's played few first-class matches but he strikes me as being one of the genuine successes of the tour, so he is credit.
Ollie Robinson
Did not play because of an ongoing back spasm.
Agnew: He's not had a great tour. He would have bowled well on the Grenada pitch. There was a lot of talk in Hobart about his fitness from the bowling coach and then he's had a back spasm here, which hasn't allowed him on the pitch at all.
Wilson: He's absolutely got work to do - it is a real worry for him and England. The fact that a back spasm has kept him out of all three games - they usually only keep you out of one. What I found concerning was the build-up to the second Test is that everything seemed to be working properly and then something went wrong when he was being considered for selection. He also bowled in between the second and third Test and then something went wrong again and he went backwards and was unavailable."
Sports,"I would tell Joe Root to step down as England skipper, says former captain Michael Vaughan
Former England captain Michael Vaughan says he would tell Joe Root to step down if he asked for his advice.
Root, who has been Test captain since 2017, is under pressure with England winless in nine games and having only won one of their past 17.
They have lost their last four series, including a 4-0 Ashes defeat and a 1-0 loss in West Indies, which ended with a 10-wicket defeat on Sunday.
""He's taken it as far as he possibly can,"" Vaughan told BBC Radio 5 Live.
Vaughan, who has known Root since he played for Sheffield Collegiate growing up, added: ""If he rings me in the next week and asks for some advice I'll be dead honest - I'd tell him to step down.
""Will England be any worse off not having him as a captain? I don't think they would, because they are going to get his runs and a senior player.
""They'll get a great role model - I don't think there is a better role model in English cricket.""
'It feels like the end of an era - it would not surprise me if Root was replaced' - Agnew column
Root wants to stay as England captain
TMS podcast: Root to get the boot?
Root has led England in a record 64 Tests, winning 27 games - more than any other captain - but losing on 26 occasions, which is also more than any other skipper.
His position came under pressure after the Ashes defeat but said he wanted to continue, and he reiterated that on Sunday, saying he is ""very passionate about taking the team forward"" and he had ""the support of the changing room"".
England are without a director of cricket and head coach after Ashley Giles and Chris Silverwood left the respective roles following the Ashes, with Sir Andrew Strauss and Paul Collingwood taking up interim roles for the West Indies series.
Both permanent appointments - and a decision about the captaincy - are expected before England's next Test against New Zealand on 2 June.
Vaughan, who captained England 51 times between 2003 and 2008, added: ""I wouldn't want the new director of cricket or head coach to sack him - he's deserved the right to go on his own ground.
""During his reign I don't think he has been helped at all. His first Ashes series there was the Ben Stokes incident, then we had the white-ball reset, then he's had Covid and it's been very difficult.
""But, I always think captains should pride themselves on maximising every ounce of potential in the changing room. I just look at the team and ask why did they perform so under their potential? That would be a real concern for me.
""Tactically he has been poor. It has been a common trend under Joe - he hasn't managed to grab a game. If he does carry on he'll really need someone who can drive the tactical side of the game with him.""
Former England assistant coach Paul Farbrace told 5 Live that he would decide it was ""probably time for a change"" if he took up the vacant head coach role.
""He is still England's best player but we've got a stage where we probably need to say 'come on, we need someone'. When he gets home he may think very differently about this,"" said Farbrace.
However, James Anderson, who is England's all-time leading Test wicket-taker, voiced his support for Root: ""If you get the right people in those two jobs above him then he can still do a really good job.""
Collingwood, who is interested in the permanent coaching role, also told BBC Sport that Root had been ""magnificent"" in the West Indies and ""shown a real drive and determination to turn things around"".
'I don't see a future England captain'
If Root was to stand down, a lack of a ready-made replacement is a concern, with all-rounder Ben Stokes the most experienced having deputised for Root while he was at the birth of his child in July 2020.
However, speaking after the Ashes, Stokes said he had ""never really had an ambition to be a captain"", leading to suggestions that England may opt for a shorter-term solution like Stuart Broad, who was left out of the West Indies tour.
""I don't see any replacement to Root doing the role long term,"" said Vaughan.
""Whoever gets it now potentially could just do it for a few months or until the end of the Ashes next year.
""I don't think Broad is the most stupid suggestion - you've got to be sensible about every name at the moment because we don't have massive riches.
""It is the first time in my lifetime where we've not had a future England captain playing and that is a real concern.""
Farbrace, now director of cricket at Warwickshire, said Stokes was the ""obvious option"" and Broad, who captained England in Twenty20 cricket from 2011 to 2014, was a ""good option"".
""We may have to go short term and someone like Broad may be a good option for 12 months to get England winning again,"" said Farbrace.
""What we can't have is picking a player just to be a captain - we can't go back to those bad old days. It has to be someone that is worth their place and someone who is going to consistently play in the next 12 months, that is why Stokes and Broad are the only two options.""
However, West Indies all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite does not think that England should add to Stokes' workload - with the 30-year-old a key component of the side in all three formats.
""I don't think Ben Stokes can do it long term because of the amount of energy that he puts into the game,"" Brathwaite told BBC Radio 5 Live.
""He is a leader and there are certain players like Stokes and Jonny Bairstow who don't need the title of captain to be a leader or help drive the culture.""

Sports,"Meg Lanning: Australia's captain desperate for World Cup success
Meg Lanning has won more than 200 caps for Australia
We live in a world where little is left to the imagination.
Revealing details about our lives is done with the touch of a button, anything from sending a picture of what you're having for dinner to a WhatsApp group, to a celebrity documenting their Caribbean holiday on Instagram.
Social media has made professional sportsmen and women more accessible than ever, bringing them closer to the fans who idolise them and ultimately pay their wages.
It feels valuable to have the opportunity to learn about the person behind the athlete. What makes them tick, what they do away from sport and the real-life experiences that have shaped them as human beings seem more interesting than how well they are hitting the ball in the nets or which end they prefer to bowl at.
Which brings us to Meg Lanning, who has managed to piece together a career as perhaps the best batter to ever play women's cricket while barely revealing anything about herself.
Lanning is captain of an Australia side that is probably the strongest international sports team, male or female, on the planet. By the time the 30-year-old finishes her career, she is likely to have numbers matched by no other woman. Her cut shot is so precise, it could take the head off a dandelion from 100 yards.
Lanning scores unbeaten 135 as Australia beat South Africa
And yet, even those who have played in the same team as Lanning admit to knowing little about her. The biggest revelation from a near-forensic trawl of the internet is that she doesn't like eating coriander.
Watching Lanning in action paints a picture of an ice-cold winning machine. Automatic, unflappable and almost emotionless.
A conversation with her reveals the opposite. Lanning is likeable and modest, open enough to admit she is a ""guarded"" person who finds captaincy much more stressful than she makes it look.
She hates one nickname - 'The Megastar' - and laughs at another: 'Serious Sally'.
""I don't tend to open too much,"" she says. ""I've got a small circle of friends who I really trust and I go along with them rather than worrying too much about what's happening on the outside.""
The fourth of five children, Lanning's early cricket was with younger sister Anna, herself a good enough batter to play for Melbourne Stars. A narrow concrete path was their pitch, with a wall on one side and windows on the other encouraging them to play straight.
Lanning's sporting ambition was actually to play hockey for Australia at the Olympics, with cricket only taking over around the age of 17. She made her first international hundred at 18 and was captain at 21, the youngest person to do either for an Australian cricket team.
Even now, in her ninth year as skipper and undisputed leader of a team that dominates women's cricket, Lanning has to battle with her reserved nature.
""The biggest challenge that I have found, even today, is building relationships with everyone in the team and trying to understand how to best get the most out of people,"" she says.
""It doesn't come naturally to me.""
With an eye on life away from cricket, Lanning has completed a degree in health and exercise science. Because of the commitments of her day job, a three-year course took eight to finish.
In that time, Australia have not lost any of the three Ashes series in which Lanning has been in charge (she missed one through injury), and won three of the four T20 World Cups.
The last such instance, on home soil in 2020, came with the added pressure of trying to 'Fill the 'G' - a push to sell out the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground for the final on International Women's Day.
Australia eventually got there, memorably celebrating on stage with Katy Perry after getting their hands on the trophy in front of a crowd of 86,174, but not before almost being eliminated in the group stage.
""It was very stressful,"" says Lanning. ""I don't think I've felt so nervous.
""It felt like people were saying 'Australia is the best team, they'll get there', but that's not how it works. We could have been out of the World Cup in two games, which would have been a disaster.
""We tried to talk it down as much as we could, but we felt it. There's no doubt about that.""
Meg Lanning celebrates with the T20 World Cup trophy in March 2020
Now, Australia are looking for the one trophy they do not currently possess. As overwhelming favourites to win the 50-over World Cup, they meet West Indies in Wellington in the semi-finals on Wednesday. Lanning is the tournament's second-highest run-scorer.
Five years ago, Australia were dumped out in the last four by India, the eventual runners-up to England. For Lanning, the experience was physically painful. She played with visible strapping on her shoulder, an injury which would later require surgery.
""That was clearly not a great time,"" says Lanning. ""Now that's what I really want to do. I want us to win and I want to personally contribute to that.""
That desire leads to Lanning's World Cup experience being ""highly stressful"". She admits to a ""fair bit"" of her day being taken up thinking about cricket, to the extent that she is trying to teach herself to switch off from the game.
She confesses to being unable to sit still, so will escape to play golf when she can. Even on training days, she has been spotted doing extra running around the Wellington waterfront.
To be so consumed by cricket leads to the question of what Lanning will be left with when her playing career is over, even if her best years might still be to come.
""As a player, everything is pretty much dictated to you in terms of where you need to be and what you need to do,"" she says. ""Then you might find yourself having to do all that stuff for yourself, and you're not really used to it.
""I can't go on forever and I haven't come up with an answer yet.
""It's a bit scary, to be honest.""
For now, Lanning is the figurehead of the premier women's cricket team on the planet. Her talent with the bat and leadership of the Australia juggernaut has created a public profile. Even if she has not looked for the spotlight, there are parts of being a recognisable figure she can embrace.
""If young girls and boys take up the game because they see us playing on TV, enjoying ourselves and having fun, that's a good thing,"" she says.
""We're lucky to be in a position to have an influence and we want to make sure it's a positive one.
""It's a really cool thing and something I actually really enjoy.""
Lanning might hate the nickname, but she really is a 'Megastar'."
Sports,"England in West Indies: Tourists' series defeat feels like the end of an era - Jonathan Agnew
England are now winless in nine Tests and have only won one of their last 17
England's 10-wicket defeat by West Indies was a thoroughly deflating experience for anyone interested in English cricket.
England have billed this as a new era, talked about a better atmosphere, but in the end it was same old, same old.
They were hammered in three and a half days, with another chaotic batting collapse thrown in for good measure. From that perspective, nothing has changed.
It leaves the team in a very fragile position.
There is no managing director and no head coach, only a beleaguered captain hanging on by his fingernails.
You could not help but feel a sense of an end of an era in Grenada - but Joe Root will not resign.
TMS podcast: Root to get the boot?
He has said as much and still has that sparkle when you look in his eyes - he wants to do his best for the team.
However, there comes a point when you have to stop and ask whether him continuing is in the team's best interests.
These things do come to an end. Like in football, teams tune out from what they are hearing from a manager. Have this team tuned out from Joe Root as captain?
Only they will know, but it would not surprise me if, when the new coach and managing director is in place, they decide to move on with a new captain.
One thing is for certain, after a run of one win in 17 Tests, after the Ashes defeat and now this loss, Root's future as captain is out of his hands.
Root wants to stay as England captain
Third Test may be Root's last as captain - Vaughan
Report: England suffer 10-wicket defeat and lose three-Test series 1-0
TMS podcast: England defeat casts doubts over Root's future
A colleague in the press box said to me that this defeat reminded them of the Oval Test of 1999 against New Zealand, when Nasser Hussain's England team were booed by their own fans.
On that occasion captain Hussain and coach Duncan Fletcher came together and took the team forward.
It does feel like that again because there are so many holes in the whole structure of English cricket, and on the field England have a 'rabbit in the headlights' mentality they cannot get rid of.
We saw it during the Ashes and it has reared its ugly head again, on day three when England collapsed to 101-8 in their second innings after the West Indies lower-order batted with relative ease earlier in the day.
It was not the easiest pitch to bat on - there was some uneven bounce - but when the pressure is applied to this England batting line-up they fall apart.
They had batted well in the first two Tests, albeit on flat pitches. What is disappointing is the confidence England's batsmen should have gained from that did not materialise in the third Test.
We saw poor batting and moments of madness, like Zak Crawley getting out on the drive again, or Ben Foakes' run-out.
These things happen to teams when they lose that habit of winning matches.
The very best sides, like the West Indies or Australia teams of old, know when the going gets tough they will get over the line. When you get to that point you're halfway there.
England, on the other hand, have lost that completely. When you are not in the best place mentally you do not make clear decisions, as we saw with Dan Lawrence leaving the ball and getting bowled.
When England's batting is put under pressure the wheels fall off.
The inability to get over the line is also why the decision to leave out James Anderson and Stuart Broad for this series has to be viewed as a mistake.
England are not going to turn this around until they start getting wins under their belt so you cannot go away from home, to the Caribbean where they have only won once since 1968, without your two best bowlers.
England cannot go into the first Test of the summer without those two. They may have moved on, but not that much.
That said, even after this series there are some positives.

In his first Test series, Alex Lees showed he has a technique for opening the batting. He may have only scored 126 runs at an average of 21 but he has a solid technique. After some of the quirky set-ups we have seen in England colours in the past few years, that is a start.
Lawrence, even with that poor final dismissal, showed a good attitude and attacking flair with the bat.
Despite the talk about the captaincy, Root is still knocking out hundreds, Ben Stokes looked back to his best in his fine second-Test century, Saqib Mahmood looks the part with the ball and Matthew Fisher seems a decent bowling prospect.
After the Ashes I gave my blueprint about how the England and Wales Cricket Board should move forward - reducing the number of counties to raise the standard of domestic red-ball cricket.
Even if that is not the outcome, I was encouraged by Sir Andrew Strauss announcing a review into the structure of English cricket. That is vital and hopefully there will be a much better pathway for England's men's Test cricketers as a consequence.
At the moment there is a crisis of confidence among the team and a vacuum at the top of the game.
The ECB has to get its act together, make good decisions and get the right people in place so English cricket can rebuild for the future."

Speaking before this weekend's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, Russell added: ""We have a very open relationship.
""I think because we are at very different stages of our careers there is a really strong mutual respect between us. We both recognise our fight isn't with each other as it may be in some other teams.
""For us, we both want to win but at the moment we are not in a position to be able to win, so we need to work together and push in the same direction to make sure our car goes faster.""
George Russell finished fourth at the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday
Ferrari dominated the season-opening race in Bahrain last weekend as they completed a one-two with Charles Leclerc winning ahead of Carlos Sainz.
Red Bull's world champion Max Verstappen and team-mate Sergio Perez both retired from the race, with Hamilton finishing third and Russell fourth.
Russell recognises Mercedes are behind their rivals at the moment but has full faith in the team to soon get them back fighting at the front.
""At the moment we know that if we do absolutely everything perfectly we still don't have the pace in the car to fight with the Red Bull and Ferrari,"" he said.
""We don't really know what our timeline is. We are working as hard as possible to resolve our issues but the only way we find out if are going to resolve them is when we jump on the track.
""I trust in my team and if anyone can overcome these issues I am sure Mercedes can.""
After it was confirmed they would be team-mates, a picture of an 11-year-old Russell chasing an autograph from a then 24-year-old Hamilton was widely circulated.
Asked what it takes for a young hopeful to one day realise his dream of becoming a Formula 1 driver, Russell said: ""You need to do far more, you need to do more than everybody else, [do] what will make you stand out.
""You are fighting for a place in the top 20 in the world and even then, for a superb driver to join Formula 1 a great driver has to leave and there has to be an opening out there for you."""
Sports,"Lewis Hamilton & Newcastle: Why is Saudi Arabia's involvement in sport controversial?
Lewis Hamilton raced in a rainbow-coloured helmet for last season's Saudi Arabian and Qatari grands prix. On Friday he said: ""Ultimately it is the responsibility of those in power to make the changes and we're not really seeing enough. We need to see more.""
Britain's seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton has repeated his call for Saudi Arabia to improve its human rights record on the eve of the country's second ever grand prix.
The Gulf kingdom is one of the states accused of investing in sport and using high-profile events to 'sports wash' its reputation in other parts of the world.
Premier League club Newcastle were bought last year by a group led by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund - prompting similar concerns.
The Saudi Public Investment Fund (PIF), which provided 80% of funds for the deal, gave the Premier League ""legally binding assurances"" that it was run separately from the state.
Many Newcastle fans welcomed the takeover, but critics condemned the deal as ""an extremely bitter blow for human rights defenders"".
Hamilton says he is not comfortable racing in the country and that it is not the driver's ""responsibility"" where to race - but that they are ""duty bound"" to raise awareness.
Here are some of the reasons why Saudi Arabi's involvement in sport has proved controversial.

Use of the death penalty
Saudi Arabia is among the countries carrying out the most executions.
In March it executed 81 men in a single day - more than during the whole of last year. They were convicted of ""multiple heinous crimes"", including terrorism, kidnapping and rape, state news agency SPA said.
Human rights group Reprieve has said there have been a further 16 executions since then, and 108 in total so far this year.
Rights organisations say many do not receive fair trials in Saudi Arabia, an allegation the government rejects.
Hamilton also referenced the case of Abdullah al-Howaiti, who was arrested in 2017 aged 14 and sentenced to death aged 17. His family have written to Hamilton to ask him to intervene.

Murder of a dissident journalist
Saudi Arabia's international standing was severely damaged by the 2018 killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Saudi journalist who was a prominent critic of the government.
UN-appointed human rights expert Agnes Callamard said Saudi agents had ""used state means to execute Mr Khashoggi"" at its Istanbul consulate.
Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and other senior officials were incriminated. Although the crown prince denied any involvement, his reputation was badly tarnished.
After the kingdom's Public Investment Fund was allowed to buy an 80% stake in Newcastle United, Mr Khashoggi's fiancée, Hatice Cengiz, called the takeover ""heart-breaking"".
OVERVIEW:
Jailing of women's rights activists
Loujain al-Hathloul was released in February after after almost three years in detention
In 2018, Saudi authorities arrested 13 women's rights activists who had led a campaign to lift a ban on women driving.
At least four of the women were allegedly tortured and sexually harassed by interrogators.
In 2020, a terrorism tribunal found the most prominent activist, Loujain al-Hathloul, guilty of crimes against the state.
After the original sentence was upheld at an appeal, Amnesty International's Lynn Maalouf said: ""By failing to quash Loujain al-Hathloul's conviction, the Saudi Arabian authorities have clearly demonstrated that they consider peaceful activism a crime.""
Crackdown on intellectuals, clerics and reformists
Areej al-Sadhan said her brother Abdul Rahman was tortured before being jailed for 20 years for writing satirical tweets that criticised authorities
Women's rights activists have not been the only people detained as part of a crackdown against critics in Saudi Arabia, where political parties, trade unions and independent human rights groups are banned.
Dozens of human rights defenders, intellectuals, academics, clerics and reformists have also been arrested since 2017, merely for exercising their right to freedom of expression, according to international human rights organisations.
Many have faced what Amnesty International has said were grossly unfair trials on vague terrorism and cybercrime charges, and received harsh sentences, including the death penalty.
Days before the Newcastle United takeover, a court upheld a 20-year prison sentence handed to Saudi-American aid worker Abdul Rahman al-Sadhan for writing satirical tweets criticising the authorities.
His sister, Areej, said he was ""brutally tortured"" before his conviction.
The devastating war in Yemen
The war in Yemen has triggered what the UN says is the world's worst humanitarian crisis
Saudi Arabia has been heavily criticised for a military campaign in neighbouring Yemen that has caused a humanitarian catastrophe.
A Saudi-led coalition intervened in 2015 after Yemeni rebels seized control of much of the west of the country and forced the president to flee abroad.
More than 100,000 people have reportedly been killed in the fighting.
Tens of thousands are also estimated to have died from indirect causes, such as lack of food, health services and infrastructure. A partial blockade by the coalition has hampered efforts to help the 20 million people in need of humanitarian aid.
UN experts say both sides in the conflict may have committed war crimes, though the coalition has insisted it is abiding by the rules of war.
Just before Friday's Formula 1 practice session - with the weekend's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix due to take place on Sunday, 27 March - Yemen's Houthi rebels claimed responsibility for a missile attack on an oil depot about nine miles from the track in Jeddah, according to the Associated Press.
Punishment of same-sex relations
Although Saudi Arabia has no laws regarding sexual orientation or gender identity, sexual relations outside marriage, including homosexual sex, are strictly prohibited.
Under the country's interpretation of Islamic law, the death penalty is a possible punishment for same-sex sexual conduct.
It is also illegal for men to ""behave like women"" or to wear women's clothes, and vice versa.
An anti-cybercrime law criminalises online activity that goes against public order and religious morals.
In July 2020, a court sentenced a Yemeni blogger to 10 months in prison and then deportation for posting a video calling for equal rights, including for gay people."
Sports,"Formula 1 drivers given new driving standards ahead of season start
Max Verstappen was criticised for his driving last season
Formula 1 drivers have been given new driving standards guidelines before the 2022 season.
The move is part of the series of changes governing body the FIA has made to try to learn the lessons from the mistakes made last year.
The new guidelines outline the ways in which drivers overtaking and being overtaken must behave while fighting.
The onus is on drivers to take responsibility for matters such as gaining advantage by leaving the track.
This is a significant shift away from the manner in which former FIA race director Michael Masi personally intervened to tell drivers who had gone off track and gained a position to return it, and is likely to lead to more penalties.
Racing ethics became a major issue throughout 2021, especially in the context of Max Verstappen's aggressive racing tactics.
The new rules lay out guidelines for manoeuvres where cars are overtaking both on the inside and outside.
The guidelines have not been published beyond the teams, but they have been seen by BBC Sport.
Hamilton not carrying baggage after Abu Dhabi
Overtaking on the inside
The new guidelines dictate that a driver being overtaken must give ""sufficient room to an overtaking car"" if ""a significant portion"" is alongside.
The overtaking manoeuvre must be done ""in a safe and controlled manner, while enabling the car to remain within the limits of the track"".
The rules do not explicitly define what ""a significant portion"" of a car means, but they say that ""among the various factors that will be looked at by the stewards… they will consider if the overtaking car's front tyres are alongside the other car by no later than the apex of the corner"".
Overtaking on the outside
The same rules apply for overtaking on the outside. The FIA says that the requirement for a driver being overtaken to give ""sufficient room"" becomes active when ""a significant portion"" of the attacking car is alongside, with the same requirement for the manoeuvre to be safe and controlled.
The definition of ""significant portion"" again remains not precise but it does define that one factor considered will be ""if the overtaking car is ahead of the other car from the apex of the corner"".
It adds: ""The car being overtaken must be capable of making the corner while remaining within the limits of the track.""
This rule would have guaranteed a penalty for Verstappen in his infamous fight with Lewis Hamilton at Turn Four in Brazil last year.
 Verstappen was deemed by many to have forced Hamilton off the road during the Sao Paulo Grand Prix, but went unpunished
Dangerous driving
Drivers were reminded of the rule that dictates no car may ""be driven unnecessarily slowly, erratically or in a manner which could be deemed potentially dangerous to other drivers or any other person"".
Unfortunately, the document sent out by the the FIA refers to the wrong number of article in the sporting regulations - it indicates the number this clause had last year - 27.4 - not the number it has this year, which is 33.4.
The document was sent out to teams only at the Bahrain Grand Prix, and it does not refer directly to the stipulations in the sporting code to do with dangerous driving.
This says: ""More than one change of direction to defend a position is not permitted.
""Any driver moving back towards the racing line, having earlier defended his position off-line, should leave at least one car width between his own car and the edge of the track on the approach to the corner.
""However, manoeuvres liable to hinder other drivers, such as deliberate crowding of a car beyond the edge of the track or any other abnormal change of direction, are strictly prohibited. Any driver who appears guilty of any of the above offences will be reported to the stewards.""
Giving back an advantage
The new guidelines dictate: ""If a driver, for example, short-cuts a chicane or a corner, it is his or her responsibility to clearly give back the advantage he or she gained. This may include giving back the timing advantage up to drop back a position behind the relevant driver.""
Insiders believe this refusal of race control to directly intervene quickly in such incidents is likely to lead to more penalties as the competitive nature of drivers and teams may well mean they are reluctant to take action themselves."
Sports,"Bevan French: Wigan full-back to play for first time since May 2021
Bevan French has scored 26 tries in 34 appearances for Wigan Warriors since his move from the NRL
Wigan Warriors coach Matt Peet says he is ""not expecting too much"" as Bevan French makes his long-awaited return from injury.
Full-back French, 26, has been named in the Wigan squad for Thursday's Super League game at home to Hull FC.
The Australian has not played since May 2021 due to a hamstring injury.
""Bevan will play,"" confirmed Peet. ""He's an exciting and unpredictable player but we won't be expecting too much from him this week.""
French has scored 26 tries in 34 appearances for Wigan since his move from Australian NRL side Parramatta Eels in 2019.
Following his injury last summer, he returned to Australia for rehabilitation and to care for his mother, who passed away in January.
But Peet said he was now fit and ready to resume his Super League career.
""He's shown glimpses that he's ready to come and compete,"" Peet added. ""He's back amongst the lads and enjoying training.
""Bevan is working hard. This week, I'll just be happy to see him out there and competing hard.""
Centre Iain Thornley also returns to the squad for the first time since injuring his ankle in the 24-10 win at Hull KR in the opening game of the season last month."
Sports,"Daryl Powell: Warrington boss says 'not many teams fear playing us' in scathing assessment after cup exit
Daryl Powell is in his first season in charge of Warrington having left Castleford at the end of the 2021 season
Warrington boss Daryl Powell says none of his squad are currently performing well in a scathing assessment following their Challenge Cup sixth-round defeat by Wakefield.
Sunday's loss was the second at home to Trinity in the space of eight days.
The Wire, who had led 12-0 against Wakefield before losing 16-12, have now lost four games back to back.
""At the minute I don't think there're many teams who fear playing against us,"" he told BBC Radio Merseyside.
""We've just been beaten twice by Wakefield at home. We've been beaten by Catalans at home. It's ridiculous. It's clearly not good enough.
""I've asked them the question. How many players are playing consistently well? That's none, being absolutely honest.""
Since Powell's arrival at the club from Castleford for the start of this season, he has led them to three wins from seven matches in all competitions.
His side are currently sixth in Super League, with three wins.
Powell continued: ""If we get something wrong and give a penalty away, for example, we are under so much pressure. We cannot keep a team out on our own try-line.
""Mentally you've got to be in a place where you can do what you need to do in a tough arena. [But] it is a tough arena. Get over it and get on with it.
""The players have to be able to trust each other implicitly on a rugby field and I don't think we've got that at the moment.
""I don't think at any point from round one we've handled being put under pressure. We have to have player accountability and they've got to fix themselves up in their heads."""
Sports,"Barrow 16-30 Huddersfield: Giants survive Challenge Cup sixth-round scare in Cumbria
Giants beat spirited Barrow to reach Challenge Cup quarter-finals
Huddersfield Giants survived a real sixth-round battle with Championship side Barrow Raiders to book their place in the Challenge Cup quarter-finals.
First-half tries for Luke Yates, Ricky Leutele and Sebastine Ikahihifo earned the Giants an 18-6 interval lead.
Barrow got to within a converted score three times thanks to two tries from Tee Ritson and one for Jarrad Stack.
But Jack Ashworth got the Giants' fourth try before Oliver Russell's penalty and a late Innes Senior try.
Beating the last non-Super League side left in the competition earned Huddersfield a home quarter-final with Hull in a fortnight's time.
Sebastine Ikahihifo muscled his way over for the third of Huddersfield's five tries
Huddersfield have won the cup six times but the last time was 1953, two years before Barrow won the famous old trophy for the one and only time when they beat Workington in an-all Cumbria final at Wembley in 1955.
But Barrow beat Huddersfield 38-16 the last time the two sides met in the Challenge Cup at Craven Park in 1989 - and there were times when they looked truly capable of a real upset.
Huddersfield, who had made seven changes, looked on course for a comfortable passage into the last eight after early tries from Yates and Leutele, both converted by Russell but then flying winger Ritson came up with a real game changer.
Close to his own line, he intercepted Ash Goulding's pass and was off away and uncatchable, running almost the entire length of the field to score.
Former Bradford Bulls, London Broncos, Leigh and Wigan half-back Jarrod Sammut added the first of the two conversions to make it 12-6 only for the bubble to be quickly burst when Barrow were caught on the hop by a refereeing call two minutes from half-time - and Ikahihifo crashed through weak tackling to score.
Tee Ritson ruffled some feathers with his two tries either side of half-time
Russell added the extras to restore the 12-point cushion but, within four minutes of the restart, Barrow were back in business again when Ritson - last season's top League One try scorer - darted in at the right corner.
Sammut missed the kick before Ashworth's unconverted try stretched the Giants' lead to 22-10.
Jarrad Stack made it a contest again when he got Barrow's third try, Sammut improving to make it 22-16.
But Russell's penalty had already effectively closed the door before the controversial Senior try which closed the scoring in the final minute.
Huddersfield appeared to get away with a ball steal in the tackle, but man of the match Russell appropriately had the final word as his fifth kick of the afternoon confirmed that safe but far from smooth passage to the last eight - and Barrow's first home defeat since 2018.
Barrow coach Paul Crarey:
""We put a lot of effort in. If we had got a try in that spell when we went three straight sets, it would have been game on. But we relieved the pressure for them by being offside and, when they got down the other end, I knew then it was tall order.
""It was a massive effort to even stay with a top-four Super League team. My part-time boys gave everything they've got.
""We put some good shape on well and we didn't waver from that. We stuck to our process and the difference was probably the lack of clinical finishing in the second half with the amount of possession we had.""
Huddersfield coach Ian Watson told BBC Radio Leeds:
""The job was to get in, get it done, get through to the quarter-finals and keep a few fresh to face Catalans next week - and we did that, but Barrow were outstanding.
""They never let up, the way they attacked was tremendous and we had to defend well. We started well with the right mentality and it was probably that which won us the game""
""It was a poor pass that led to Ritson's interception try but it made it into a contest which proved great entertainment for everyone that turned out. Barrow's performance highlighted the quality of the Championship.""

Sports,"Challenge Cup: Wakefield Trinity fight back to overcome Warrington Wolves
Corey Hall grabbed the decisive try as Wakefield edged out Warrington
Wakefield reached the Challenge Cup quarter-finals by coming from behind to edge out Warrington in a tense clash.
Trinity trailed after early tries by Connor Wrench and Josh Thewlis put Warrington 12-0 up.
But Lewis Murphy replied and Reece Lyne and Corey Hall went over in the second half to seal Trinity's first Challenge Cup win at Warrington since 1963.
Wakefield's victory sets up a home tie against Wigan in the quarter-finals in a fortnight's time.
Warrington controlled the opening stages and gained their reward with back-to-back tries from distance as Wrench dived over in the corner before Danny Walker set up Thewlis for the second.
But the visitors responded and, although a push for the line foundered through Lyne's knock-on, Max Jowitt and Hall combined to send Murphy over and make it 12-6 at half-time.
Wakefield continued to look dangerous in attack and levelled the tie as Liam Kay found Lyne, who sped in from 25 yards out.
Two minutes later, Hall collected Jowitt's pass to cross for the decisive try and, although Mason Lino missed a difficult conversion, it made no difference as Trinity held on to repeat last week's league success at Halliwell Jones Stadium.

Rampant Castleford tore Leeds apart with a seven-try blitz to secure a resounding win at Headingley.
The Tigers, who were beaten finalists last season, ran in five unanswered tries before half-time.
Leeds fought back, with Rhyse Martin going over twice to reduce the deficit to 18 points.
But Greg Eden replied with two tries as Cas clinched their first Challenge Cup success over Leeds since 1998.
Castleford ripped through the Rhinos' ragged defence time and again in the first half, with Jacob Trueman and Jake Mamo bursting clear before Gareth O'Brien forced his way over for a third try.
The outlook became even gloomier for Leeds before half-time as Brad Dwyer was sin-binned for a trip - and the visitors capitalised on the extra space to stretch their lead to 28-0 with tries by Jordan Turner and George Lawler.
Interim Leeds coach Jamie Jones-Buchanan appeared to galvanise his troops at the interval and they responded with back-to-back scores from Martin and Liam Sutcliffe.

Andre Savelio was one of eight different Hull FC try-scorers in Sheffield
Hull FC scored 11 tries to thrash Championship side Sheffield Eagles 58-12 and seal their place in the Challenge Cup quarter-finals.
The Black and Whites went over five times in the first half, with two from Connor Wynne, who powered home to complete his hat-trick after the break.
Jake Connor, who scored the first try after two minutes, was among those to add gloss to the win late on.
Former Hull KR man Kris Welham grabbed one of Eagles' two consolation tries.
Hull's sharp attack raced into the the lead when full-back Connor lunged through after a last-ditch tackle to thwart Ben McNamara on the try-line.
Moments later, Adam Swift enjoyed the freedom of Post Office Road after being released by centre Josh Griffin, as he sprinted for home to put the visitors into double figures.
Sheffield started to grow in confidence, with scrum-half Anthony Thackeray key to their build-up play, and his team-mate Matty Chrimes looked like he was about to score before Wynne made a brilliant late challenge.
Wynne then showed his effectiveness at the other end by scoring twice - first planting the ball down after a neat, flicked Carlos Tuimavave lay-off - before calmly stepping inside to finish off a slick move after Andre Savelio broke through the Eagles line.
Those tries came either side of Savelio scoring from a one-on-one five metres from the line, with Griffin, Tuimawave and Connor building Hull an emphatic 44-0 lead in the second half.
Welham restored some pride for the hosts as he powered home on the right, with Tom Holmes converting both that try and one of his own shortly afterwards, before Vujikijapani, Lane and Wynne had the final say.

Sports,"Challenge Cup: Hull KR cling on to beat Leigh Centurions
Frankie Halton scored the Robins' opening try
Hull KR survived a late scare against Leigh Centurions to reach the last eight of the Challenge Cup.
The Championship side led through Ben Reynolds' penalty, but tries by Frankie Halton, Mikey Lewis and Matt Parcell seemed to put the Robins in control.
Matty Storton then added a fourth try to make it 24-2 in the second half.
Keanan Brand, Jacob Jones and Joe Mellor all went over for Leigh to threaten a comeback but Hull KR hung on for victory.
Leigh started strongly, edging in front when Reynolds kicked a 13th-minute penalty and that lead stood until Lewis offloaded for second-rower Halton to break the tackle and cross the line.
Rovers quickly increased their advantage as Lewis began and finished the move that led to their second try and Parcell forced his way over from dummy half to make it 18-2 at the interval.
Parcell set up Storton to crash over before Brand gave the Centurions a glimmer of hope, pouncing on a grubber-kick to score.
The Robins looked sluggish in the closing stages but, although Edwin Ipape set up Jones and Mellor then narrowed the deficit to six points, Leigh ran out of time.

England have called up former cricketer Courtney Winfield-Hill and ex-goalkeeper Caroline Collie to their Women's Rugby League World Cup squad.
Leeds Rhinos half-back Winfield-Hill, 35, played cricket for Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash as well as Queensland before moving to England in 2018.
She married England cricketer Lauren Winfield in 2020 and qualifies for England under the residency rule.
Former Arsenal and Chelsea goalkeeper Collie, 35, has also been selected.
Collie becomes the first player from the Women's Super League South - which was launched in 2021 - to be selected for the England performance squad after an impressive debut season with Bedford Tigers.
""We watched Caroline on several occasions and she really impressed with her speed and agility,"" head coach Craig Richards said.
""She's a big running threat and has the ability and confidence to score tries from anywhere on the field, while her frame also makes her a handful in general play for defenders.""
Richards said the inclusion of Australia-born Winfield-Hill owed to ""a lot of work behind the scenes"".
""Courtney has consistently proven herself as one of the leading players in the Betfred Women's Super League and has been pivotal to Leeds Rhinos' success,"" he added.
""She gives us another impressive option in the halves as we prepare, and will create even more competition for places as we head into the mid-season international with France and the Rugby League World Cup on home soil this autumn.""

Sports,"Chevron Championship: England's Georgia Hall buoyant for first women's major of 2022
Thailand's Patty Tavatanakit took the traditional dunking in Poppie's Pond after winning last year at Mission Hills
Georgia Hall noted immediately after her recent victory in Saudi Arabia the importance of notching a win early in the season.
That five-stroke triumph sets up the British number one for the first major of the year. Hall should be taking a healthy dose of confidence to this week's Chevron Championship at Mission Hills Country Club, Rancho Mirage, California.
""It's fantastic to win in March,"" Hall said, no doubt with one eye on the first of the five annual women's majors, which has changed identity from its previous incarnation, the ANA Inspiration.
Two more UK stars, Charley Hull and Northern Ireland's Stephanie Meadow, will be encouraged by their top-10 finishes down the road in Carlsbad last week.
Indeed, it promises to be a poignant week for the women's game as it will be the last time this tournament is played on the iconic Dinah Shore Tournament Course.
It has been a fixture since American Jane Blalock banked $20,000 for her three-stroke win at the inaugural staging, played over only three rounds, back in 1972.
Within 11 years the tournament acquired major status, such was the allure of the spectacular course and the quality of field it attracted.
Under the latest deal, the event switches next year to Houston, Texas and will be played in May. This means it will no longer clash with the recently instituted Augusta National Women's Amateur, the Masters curtain-raiser in Georgia.
Former Women's Open champion Hall would become the first British winner and only the fifth European victor if she can maintain current form and fight off a field that includes nine of the world's top 10.
The second-ranked Nelly Korda will be missed. She continues to be treated for a blood clot in her arm but the line-up remains formidable, especially with the astonishing form of world number one Ko Jin-young.
The 26-year-old Korean claimed this title in 2019, one of two major titles to her name, and has won four of her past five tournaments including the recent HSBC Women's World Championship in Singapore.
Since coming ninth at the Olympics, Ko has not finished outside the top 10 in nine consecutive tournaments, winning five of them. That is a performance level reminiscent of Tiger Woods in his pomp and she is a justifiable short-odds favourite.
World number four Minjee Lee, the winner in Evian last July, when Ko incongruously finished 60th, is looking to trade on her newly acquired major champion status.
""I think the confidence I gained in winning the Amundi Evian Championship last year should really help,"" said the 25-year-old Australian. ""So I am really looking forward to our first major of 2022.""
And like all of the leading contenders, Lee already has half an eye on the traditional celebration that accompanies victories in this week's California-staged championship.
""It's our last chance to win and make the historic winner's leap into Poppie's Pond,"" she said. ""I think the course suits my game pretty well.""
It is a layout that works for a variety of styles of play. Last year the exciting Thai Patty Tavatanakit claimed her debut major title with a powerful display that thrillingly held off a charging Lydia Ko, the world number three.
Back in 2013 it was the more sedate style of Inbee Park that prevailed and the experienced Korean is relishing one last tilt at glory on the Dinah Shore course.
""I think the excitement is raised to a whole new level,"" said the 33-year-old from Seoul. ""We are welcoming fans back to Mission Hills for the first time since 2019 and it's the final edition at Rancho Mirage.
""It is going to be a huge week for women's golf, and I am hoping I can play my best.""
It will be exciting to see how Ireland's Leona Maguire fares having broken into the world's top 20 off the back of her sensational Solheim Cup debut last September.
An LPGA Tour winner, after victory at the Drive On Championship in early February, the tenacious Irishwoman will be looking to improve upon her best major performance, a share of sixth at last year's Evian.
Another hero of Europe's stunning Solheim Cup win is Anna Nordqvist, the most recent major winner after her superb triumph at Carnoustie in the AIG Women's Open last August.
The Angus coast does not share too many characteristics with the California desert, but the current world number 17 is capable of emulating fellow Swedish champions Annika Sorenstam (three times), Helen Alfredsson (Europe's first winner) and Pernilla Lindberg (2019). Nordqvist boasts four top-10 finishes in this event, although none since coming fourth in 2015.
But whoever makes that final splash, there is one certainty. It will be an emotionally charged week. The women's game is saying farewell to one its favourite venues and with it, its most recognisable tournament identity."

Scheffler had reached the final after defeating former world number one Dustin Johnson in their semi-final earlier on Sunday.
Scheffler made a fast start, was three up after four holes, and five ahead after the 11th.
But Johnson won four straight holes to threaten a comeback before Scheffler kept his cool and birdied the 17th for victory.
In the other semi-final, Kisner won 2&1 over Canada's Corey Conners, who then went on to beat Johnson 3&1 in the third-place play-off.
Scheffler, who eliminated defending champion Billy Horschel in the last 16 on Saturday, made another fast start against world number 34 Kisner in the final.
He was three up after six holes after Kisner bogeyed the second hole before birdies for Scheffler on the fourth and sixth.
Scheffler extended his lead with another birdie on the 14th and, after Kisner missed a birdie putt on the 15th that would have extended the match, his opponent was left to two-putt for the championship.
""He's playing incredible golf. I knew I needed my best -just couldn't get my putter to cooperate,"" Kisner said."

Ferguson admitted pressure got to him when he blew a four-shot lead in the final round of the Kenyan Open earlier this month.
But the 25-year-old used that experience to get himself over the line in what he described as ""brutal"" blustery conditions.
Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound, Ferguson added: ""I took a lot from [Kenya]. I tried to keep myself in the mix knowing that you never know what's going to happen.
""I felt, if I got to the last hole and left a putt short and just missed out, it would've been really upsetting, but I made a nice putt on the last hole to get over the line.
""I'm bringing back a nice cheque. Money isn't what it's all about, but it's nice to pick that up. I'll be able to put it towards getting a new house that I'm trying to get back home in Glasgow."""
